Research article - A systematic literature review on semantic web enabled software testing,"AbstractSoftware testing, as a major verification and validation activity which revolves around quality tests, is a knowledge-intensive activity. Hence, it is reasonable to expect that it can be improved by effective application of semantic web technologies, e.g., ontologies, which have been frequently used in knowledge engineering activities.The objective of this work is to investigate and provide a better understanding of how semantic web enabled techniques, i.e., the techniques that are based on the effective application of the semantic web technologies, have been used to support software testing activities. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review based on a predefined procedure is conducted. A total of 52 primary studies were identified as relevant, which have undergone a thorough meta-analysis with regards to our posed research questions.This study indicates the benefits of semantic web enabled software testing in both industry and academia. It also identifies main software testing activities that can benefit from the semantic web enabled techniques. Furthermore, contributions of such techniques to the testing process are thoroughly examined. Finally, potentials and difficulties of applying these techniques to software testing, along with the promising research directions are discussed."
Research article - A framework for pervasive computing applications based on smart objects and end user development,"AbstractPervasive Computing (PerComp) research remains to this date technology-centric, requiring more focus on utilizing human and societal intelligence. To bridge this gap we motivate the need for a conceptual framework that provides a vision for enabling end-users to participate actively in the design of PerComp applications. The framework in particular provides guidance for the development of tools that allow end-users to configure their own smart environments. It emphasizes the benefits of using Smart Objects (SOs) as components of PerComp applications under a system engineering perspective and the benefits of using affordances as dynamic connectable capabilities under a user experience perspective. A generic application model is developed within the framework that manifests the concepts governing the structure and operation of applications composed by connecting SOs together and adhering to a rule-based behavior. A multi-layered software mediator is defined to provide a platform for the runtime support of such PerComp applications. Theoretical foundations for the key concepts adopted regarding the interaction design and system engineering perspectives are discussed and the results of a user evaluation study focusing on the perceived usability of the high-level conceptual models and the developed tools are reported."
Research article - Energy-Delay investigation of Remote Inter-Process communication technologies,"AbstractMost modern information technology devices use the Internet for creating, reading, updating, and deleting shared data through remote inter-process communication (ipc). To evaluate the energy consumption of ipc technologies and the corresponding run-time performance implications, we performed an empirical study on popular ipc systems implemented in Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, php, Ruby, and C#. We performed our experiments on computer platforms equipped with Intel and arm processors. We observed that JavaScript and Go implementations of grpcoffer the lowest energy consumption and execution time. Furthermore, by analysing their system call traces, we found that inefficient use of system calls can contribute to increased energy consumption and poor execution time."
Research article - Why and how to balance alignment and diversity of requirements engineering practices in automotive,"AbstractIn large-scale automotive companies, various requirements engineering (RE) practices are used across teams. RE practices manifest in Requirements Information Models (RIM) that define what concepts and information should be captured for requirements. Collaboration of practitioners from different parts of an organization is required to define a suitable RIM that balances support for diverse practices in individual teams with the alignment needed for a shared view and team support on system level. There exists no guidance for this challenging task. This paper presents a mixed methods study to examine the role of RIMs in balancing alignment and diversity of RE practices in four automotive companies. Our analysis is based on data from systems engineering tools, 11 semi-structured interviews, and a survey to validate findings and suggestions. We found that balancing alignment and diversity of RE practices is important to consider when defining RIMs. We further investigated enablers for this balance and actions that practitioners take to achieve it. From these factors, we derived and evaluated recommendations for managing RIMs in practice that take into account the lifecycle of requirements and allow for diverse practices across sub-disciplines in early development, while enforcing alignment of requirements that are close to release."
Research article - Cost-efficient dynamic scheduling of big data applications in apache spark on cloud,"AbstractJob scheduling is one of the most crucial components in managing resources, and efficient execution of big data applications. Specifically, scheduling jobs in a cloud-deployed cluster are challenging as the cloud offers different types of Virtual Machines (VMs) and jobs can be heterogeneous. The default big data processing framework schedulers fail to reduce the cost of VM usages in the cloud environment while satisfying the performance constraints of each job. The existing works in cluster scheduling mainly focus on improving job performance and do not leverage from VM types on the cloud to reduce cost. In this paper, we propose efficient scheduling algorithms that reduce the cost of resource usage in a cloud-deployed Apache Spark cluster. In addition, the proposed algorithms can also prioritise jobs based on their given deadlines. Besides, the proposed scheduling algorithms are online and adaptive to cluster changes. We have also implemented the proposed algorithms on top of Apache Mesos. Furthermore, we have performed extensive experiments on real datasets and compared to the existing schedulers to showcase the superiority of our proposed algorithms. The results indicate that our algorithms can reduce resource usage cost up to 34% under different workloads and improve job performance."
Research article - Representing software project vision by means of video: A quality model for vision videos,"AbstractEstablishing a shared software project vision is a key challenge in Requirements Engineering (RE). Several approaches use videos to represent visions. However, these approaches omit how to produce a good video. This missing guidance is one crucial reason why videos are not established in RE. We propose a quality model for videos representing a vision, so-called vision videos. Based on two literature reviews, we elaborate ten quality characteristics of videos and five quality characteristics of visions which together form a quality model for vision videos that includes all 15 quality characteristics. We provide two representations of the quality model: (a) a hierarchical decomposition of vision video quality into the quality characteristics and (b) a mapping of these characteristics to the video production and use process. While the hierarchical decomposition supports the evaluation of vision videos, the mapping provides guidance for video production. In an evaluation with 139 students, we investigated whether the 15 characteristics are related to the overall quality of vision videos perceived by the subjects from a developer’s the point of view. Six characteristics (video length, focus, prior knowledge, clarity, pleasure, and stability) correlated significantly with the likelihood that the subjects perceived a vision video as good. These relationships substantiate a fundamental relevance of the proposed quality model. Therefore, we conclude that the quality model is a sound basis for future refinements and extensions."
"Research article - Modeling, analyzing and predicting security cascading attacks in smart buildings systems-of-systems","AbstractSoftware systems intelligence and complexity have been continuously increasing to deliver more and more features to support business critical and mission critical processes in numerous domains such as defense, health-care, and smart cities. Contemporary software-based solutions are composed of several software systems, that form System-of-Systems (SoS). SoS differentiating characteristics, such as emergent behavior, introduce specific issues that render their security modeling, simulation and analysis a critical challenge. The aim of this work is to investigate how Software Engineering (SE) approaches can be leveraged to model and analyze secure SoS solutions for predicting high impact (cascading) attacks at the architecture stage. In order to achieve this objective, we propose a Model Driven Engineering method, Systems-of-Systems Security (SoSSec), that comprises: (1) a modeling language (SoSSecML) for secure SoS modeling and (2) Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for security analysis of SoS architectures. To illustrate our proposed approach in terms of modeling, simulating, and discovering attacks, we have conducted a case study on a real-life smart building SoS, the Adelaide University Health and Medical School (AHMS). The results from this case study demonstrate that our proposed method discovers cascading attacks comprising of a number of individual attacks, such as a Denial of Service, that arise from a succession of exploited vulnerabilities through interactions among the constituent systems of SoS. In future work, we intend to extend SoSSec to address diverse unknown emergent behaviors and non-functional properties such as safety and trust."
Research article - Google summer of code: Student motivations and contributions,"AbstractSeveral open source software (OSS) projects participate in engagement programs like Summers of Code expecting to foster newcomers’ onboarding and receive contributions. However, scant empirical evidence identifies why students join such programs. In this paper, we study the well-established Google Summer of Code (GSoC), which is a 3-month OSS engagement program that offers stipends and mentorship to students willing to contribute to OSS projects. We combined a survey (of students and mentors) and interviews (of students) to understand what motivates students to enter GSoC. Our results show that students enter GSoC for an enriching experience, and not necessarily to become frequent contributors. Our data suggest that, while stipends are an important motivator, students participate for work experience and the ability to enhance their resumés. We also discuss practical implications for students, mentors, OSS projects, and Summer of Code programs."
Research article - Providentia: Using search-based heuristics to optimize satisficement and competing concerns between functional and non-functional objectives in self-adaptive systems,"AbstractIn general, a system may be subject to a combination of functional requirements (FRs) that dictate behavior and non-functional requirements (NFRs) that characterize how FRs are to be satisfied. NFRs also introduce cross-cutting concerns that may be difficult to predict, where the degree of satisfaction (i.e., satisficement) of one NFR may be impacted by the satisficement of one or more FRs/NFRs. In particular, self-adaptive systems (SASs) can modify system configurations or behaviors at run time to continuously satisfy FRs and NFRs. This paper presents Providentia, a search-based technique to optimize the satisficement of NFRs in an SAS experiencing various sources of uncertainty. Providentia explores different combinations of weighted FRs to maximize NFR/FR satisficement. Experimental results suggest that Providentia-optimized goal models significantly improve the satisficement of an SAS when compared with manually- and randomly-generated weights and subgoals. Additionally, we apply a hyper-heuristic (Providentia-SAW) to balance the contribution of NFRs, FRs, and the number of adaptations and further improve the Providentia technique. We apply Providentia and Providentia-SAW to two case studies in different application domains involving a remote data mirroring network and a robotic vacuum controller, respectively."
Research article - SCC++: Predicting the programming language of questions and snippets of Stack Overflow,"AbstractStack Overflow is the most popular Q&A website among software developers. As a platform for knowledge sharing and acquisition, the questions posted on Stack Overflow usually contain a code snippet. Determining the programming language of a source code file has been considered in the research community; it has been shown that Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms can be effective in identifying the programming language of source code files. However, determining the programming language of a code snippet or a few lines of source code is still a challenging task. Online forums such as Stack Overflow and code repositories such as GitHub contain a large number of code snippets. In this paper, we design and evaluate Source Code Classification (SCC++), a classifier that can identify the programming language of a question posted on Stack Overflow. The classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.9% in classifying programming languages by combining features from the title, body and the code snippets of the question. We also propose a classifier that only uses the title and body of the question and has an accuracy of 78.9%. Finally, we propose a classifier of code snippets only that achieves an accuracy of 78.1%. These results show that deploying Machine Learning techniques on the combination of text and code snippets of a question provides the best performance. In addition, the classifier can distinguish between code snippets from a family of programming languages such as C, C++ and C#, and can also identify the programming language version such as C# 3.0, C# 4.0 and C# 5.0."
Research article - A universal cross language software similarity detector for open source software categorization,"AbstractWhile there are novel approaches for detecting and categorizing similar software applications, previous research focused on detecting similarity in applications written in the same programming language and not on detecting similarity in applications written in different programming languages. Cross-language software similarity detection is inherently more challenging due to variations in language, application structures, support libraries used, and naming conventions. In this paper we propose a novel model, CroLSim, to detect similar software applications across different programming languages. We define a semantic relationship among cross-language libraries and API methods (both local and third party) using functional descriptions and a word-vector learning model. Our experiments show that CroLSim can successfully detect cross-language similar software applications, which outperforms all existing approaches (mean average precision rate of 0.65, confidence rate of 3.6, and 75% highly rated successful queries). Furthermore, we applied CroLSim to a source code repository to see whether our model can recommend cross-language source code fragments if queried directly with source code. From our experiments we found that CroLSim can recommend cross-language functional similar source code when source code is directly used as a query (average precision=0.28, recall=0.85, and F-Measure=0.40)."
Research article - Experimental assessment of XOR-Masking data obfuscation based on K-Clique opaque constants,"AbstractData obfuscations are program transformations used to complicate program understanding and conceal actual values of program variables. The possibility to hide constant values is a basic building block of several obfuscation techniques. In XOR-Masking, a constant mask is used to obfuscate data, but this mask must be hidden too, in order to keep the obfuscation resilient to attacks.In this paper, we present a novel extension of XOR-Masking where the mask is an opaque constant, i.e. a value that is difficult to guess by static analysis. In fact, opaque constants are constructed such that static analysis should solve the k-clique problem, which is known to be NP-complete, to identify the mask value.In our experimental assessment we apply obfuscation to 12 real Java applications. We observe that obfuscation does not alter the program correctness and we record performance overhead due to obfuscation, in terms of execution time and memory consumption."
