Research article - Reliability and temperature constrained task scheduling for makespan minimization on heterogeneous multi-core platforms,"AbstractWe study the problem of scheduling tasks onto a heterogeneous multi-core processor platform for makespan minimization, where each cluster on the platform has a probability of failure governed by an exponential law and the processor platform has a thermal constraint specified by a peak temperature threshold. The goal of our work is to design algorithms that optimize makespan under the constraints of reliability and temperature. We first provide a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for assigning and scheduling independent tasks with reliability and temperature constraints on the heterogeneous platform to minimize the makespan. However, MILP takes exponential time to finish. We then propose a two-stage heuristic that determines the assignment, replication, operating frequency, and execution order of tasks to minimize the makespan while satisfying the real-time, reliability, and temperature constraints based on the analysis of the effects of task assignment on makespan, reliability, and temperature. We finally carry out extensive simulation experiments to validate our proposed MILP formulation and two-stage heuristic. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MILP formulation can achieve the best performance in reducing makespan among all the methods used in the comparison. The results also show that the proposed two-stage heuristic has a close performance as the representative existing approach ESTS and a better performance when compared to the representative existing approach RBSA, in terms of reducing makespan. In addition, the proposed two-stage heuristic has the highest feasibility as compared to RBSA and ESTS."
Research article - A framework for dynamic selection of backoff stages during initial ranging process in wireless networks,"AbstractThe only available solution in the IEEE 802.22 standard for avoiding collision amongst various contending customer premises equipment (CPEs) attempting to associate with a base station (BS) is binary exponential random backoff process in which the contending CPEs retransmit their association requests. The number of attempts the CPEs send their requests to the BS are fixed in an IEEE 802.22 network. This paper presents a mathematical framework that helps the BS in determining at which attempt the majority of the CPEs become part of the wireless regional area network from a particular number of contending CPEs. Based on a particular attempt, the ranging request collision probability for any number of contending CPEs with respect to contention window size is approximated. The numerical results validate the effectiveness of the approximation. Moreover, the average ranging success delay experienced by the majority of the CPEs is also determined."
Research article - Automatic clustering constraints derivation from object-oriented software using weighted complex network with graph theory analysis,"AbstractConstrained clustering or semi-supervised clustering has received a lot of attention due to its flexibility of incorporating minimal supervision of domain experts or side information to help improve clustering results of classic unsupervised clustering techniques. In the domain of software remodularisation, classic unsupervised software clustering techniques have proven to be useful to aid in recovering a high-level abstraction of the software design of poorly documented or designed software systems. However, there is a lack of work that integrates constrained clustering for the same purpose to help improve the modularity of software systems. Nevertheless, due to time and budget constraints, it is laborious and unrealistic for domain experts who have prior knowledge about the software to review each and every software artifact and provide supervision on an on-demand basis. We aim to fill this research gap by proposing an automated approach to derive clustering constraints from the implicit structure of software system based on graph theory analysis of the analysed software. Evaluations conducted on 40 open-source object-oriented software systems show that the proposed approach can serve as an alternative solution to derive clustering constraints in situations where domain experts are non-existent, thus helping to improve the overall accuracy of clustering results."
Research article - A multi-level feedback approach for the class integration and test order problem,"AbstractClass integration and test order (CITO) problem is to devise an optimal inter-class order which can minimize stubbing efforts. The existing approach for this problem, whether it is graph-based or search-based, usually wastes a significant amount of time and efforts in finding test orders, and sometimes may devise sub-optimal solutions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-level feedback approach to better solve the CITO problem. In this method, we use a multi-level feedback strategy to calculate test profit for each class, and according to test profit, propose a reward and punishment mechanism to assess the performance of class and set its test priority. Instead of breaking cycles or searching for optimum in the previous methods, our method integrates classes by their test priority, therefore significantly reduces the running time. The experiments are conducted on five benchmark programs and eight industrial programs, and the obtained results are compared with graph-based and search-based approaches. The results indicate that our approach can minimize the stubbing cost efficiently for most programs of all typical approaches compared in this work."
Research article - Be more familiar with our enemies and pave the way forward: A review of the roles bugs played in software failures,"AbstractThere has been an increasing frequency of failures due to defective software that cost millions of dollars. Recent high profile incidents have drawn increased attention to the risks of failed software systems to the public. Yet aside from the Therac-25 case, very few incidents of software failure causing humans harm have been proven and widely reported. With increased government oversight and the expanded use of social networking for real time reporting of problems, we are only beginning to understand the potential for major injury or death related to software failures. However, debugging defective software can be costly and time consuming. Moreover, undetected bugs could induce great harm to the public when software systems are applied in safety-critical areas, such as consumer products, public infrastructure, transportation systems, etc. Therefore, it is vital that we remove these bugs as early as possible. To gain more understanding of the nature of these bugs, we review the reported software failures that have impacted the health, safety, and welfare of the public. A focus on lessons learned and implications for future software systems is also provided which acts as guidelines for engineers to improve the quality of their products and avoid similar failures from happening."
Research article - Analysing and modelling runtime architectural stability for self-adaptive software,"AbstractWith the increased dependence on software, there is a pressing need for engineering long-lived software. As architectures have a profound effect on the life-span of the software and the provisioned quality of service, stable architectures are significant assets. Architectural stability tends to reflect the success of the system in supporting continuous changes without phasing-out. For self-adaptive architectures, the behavioural aspect of stability is essential for seamless operation, to continuously keep the provision of quality requirements stable and prevent unnecessary adaptations that will risk degrading the system. In this paper, we introduce a systematic approach for analysing and modelling architectural stability. Specifically, we leverage architectural concerns and viewpoints to explicitly analyse stability attributes of the intended behaviour. Due to the probabilistic nature of systems’ behaviour, stability modelling is based on a probabilistic relational model for knowledge representation of stability multiple viewpoints. The model, empowered by the quantitative analysis of Bayesian networks, is capable to conduct runtime inference for reasoning about stability under runtime uncertainty. To illustrate the applicability and evaluate the proposed approach, we consider the case of cloud architectures. The results show that the approach increases the efficiency of the architecture in keeping the expected behaviour stable during runtime operation."
Research article - A novel analysis approach for the design and the development of context-aware applications,"AbstractIn this paper, we propose a novel analysis approach, called ANALOG, for the design and the development of context-aware applications able to detect context change and to predict context parameter values. Our approach is described by two analysis procedures, (a) an analysis procedure for detection and (b) an analysis procedure for prediction. The proposed analysis procedures aim to offer a support for application designers allowing them to design easily context-aware applications. Each procedure is achieved by a sequence of steps performed by the designers. We describe first our analysis approach presented by the analysis procedures. Then, we give some implementation details of our approach. Afterwards, we show the usefulness of the analysis approach through presenting two execution scenarios related to a smart building case study. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present different experiments related to (i) the processing time of the analysis approach and (ii) the CPU and the memory overhead introduced by our approach."
Research article - Mining domain knowledge from app descriptions,"AbstractDomain analysis aims at gaining knowledge to a particular domain in the early stage of software development. A key challenge in domain analysis is to extract features automatically from related product artifacts. Compared with other kinds of artifacts, high volume of descriptions can be collected from App marketplaces (such as Google Play and Apple Store) easily when developing a new mobile application (App), so it is essential for the success of domain analysis to gain features and relationships from them using data analysis techniques. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine domain knowledge from App descriptions automatically, where the information of features in a single App description is firstly extracted and formally described by a Concern-based Description Model (CDM), which is based on predefined rules of feature extraction and a modified topic modeling method; then the overall knowledge in the domain is identified by classifying, clustering and merging the knowledge in the set of CDMs and topics, and the results are formalized by a Data-based Raw Domain Model (DRDM). Furthermore, we propose a quantified evaluation method for prioritizing the knowledge in DRDM. The proposed approach is validated by a series of experiments."
Research article - Reverse engineering language product lines from existing DSL variants,"AbstractThe use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) has become a successful technique to develop complex systems. In this context, an emerging phenomenon is the existence of DSL variants, which are different versions of a DSL adapted to specific purposes but that still share commonalities. In such a case, the challenge for language designers is to reuse, as much as possible, previously defined language constructs to narrow implementation from scratch. To overcome this challenge, recent research in software languages engineering introduced the notion of language product lines. Similarly to software product lines, language product lines are often built from a set of existing DSL variants.In this article, we propose a reverse-engineering technique to ease-off such a development scenario. Our approach receives a set of DSL variants which are used to automatically recover a language modular design and to synthesize the corresponding variability models. The validation is performed in a project involving industrial partners that required three different variants of a DSL for finite state machines. This validation shows that our approach is able to correctly identify commonalities and variability."
Research article - Going with the flow: An activity theory analysis of flow techniques in software development,"AbstractManaging flow is fundamental to continuous development, particularly in knowledge intensive work activities such as software development. However, while numerous articles describe flow tools and practice there is little research on their application in context. This is a significant limitation given that software development is a highly complex and socially embedded activity. This research applies activity theory (AT) to examine the adoption of flow techniques by using the multiple-case method in two companies. AT is particularly pertinent in this study as it identifies contradictions, which manifest themselves as problems such as errors or a breakdown of communication in the organisation and congruencies between flow techniques and the development context and indeed contradictions between components of flow techniques themselves. Rather than view contradictions as a threat to flow or as an argument to abandon, a theoretical contribution of this study is that it shows how contradictions and congruencies can be used to reflect, learn, and identify new ways of structuring and enacting the flow activity. It also provides an immediate practical contribution by identifying a set of lessons drawn from the cases studied that may be applicable in future implementations of flow techniques."
Research article - Transition of organizational roles in Agile transformation process: A grounded theory approach ,"AbstractThis study aims to identify how traditional organizational roles are transformed towards Agile roles. A grounded theory study with 5 software teams in a large software development company in Spain was conducted. We interviewed 21 people, participated in Agile Coaching sessions and observed daily activities in the company during a six-month period. The transition of organizational roles during the Agile transformation process is influenced by many circumstances such as: higher management commitment and support, knowledge about Agile, project team size and culture. The theory demonstrates how enterprise factors influence the transition of organizational roles and how practitioners cope with the challenges during the Agile transformation process. Based on our results, we proposed recommendations and guidelines for organizational roles transition during the Agile method adoption."
Research article - Introducing continuous experimentation in large software-intensive product and service organisations,"AbstractSoftware development in highly dynamic environments imposes high risks to development organizations. One such risk is that the developed software may be of only little or no value to customers, wasting the invested development efforts. Continuous experimentation, as an experiment-driven development approach, may reduce such development risks by iteratively testing product and service assumptions that are critical to the success of the software. Although several experiment-driven development approaches are available, there is little guidance available on how to introduce continuous experimentation into an organization. This article presents a multiple-case study that aims at better understanding the process of introducing continuous experimentation into an organization with an already established development process. The results from the study show that companies are open to adopting such an approach and learning throughout the introduction process. Several benefits were obtained, such as reduced development efforts, deeper customer insights, and better support for development decisions. Challenges included complex stakeholder structures, difficulties in defining success criteria, and building experimentation skills. Our findings indicate that organizational factors may limit the benefits of experimentation. Moreover, introducing continuous experimentation requires fundamental changes in how companies operate, and a systematic introduction process can increase the chances of a successful start."
Research article - User acceptance testing for Agile-developed web-based applications: Empowering customers through wikis and mind maps,"AbstractUser Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves validating software in a real setting by the intended audience. The aim is not so much to check the defined requirements but to ensure that the software satisfies the customer’s needs. Agile methodologies put stringent demands on UAT, if only for the frequency at which it needs to be conducted due to the iterative development of small product releases. In this setting, traditional in-person meetings might not scale up well. Complementary ways are needed to reduce the costs of developer-customer collaboration during UAT. This work introduces a wiki-based approach where customers and developers asynchronously collaborate: developers set the UAT scaffolding that will later shepherd customers when testing. To facilitate understanding, mind maps are used to represent UAT sessions. To facilitate engagement, a popular mind map editor, FreeMind, is turned into an editor for FitNesse, the wiki engine in which these ideas are borne out. The approach is evaluated through a case study involving three real customers. First evaluations are promising. Though at different levels of completeness, the three customers were able to complete a UAT. Customers valued asynchronicity, mind map structuredness, and the transparent generation of documentation out of the UAT session."
