Genetic programming for feature model synthesis: a replication study,"Software Product Lines (SPLs) make it possible to configure a single system based on features in order to create many different variants and cater to a wide range of customers with varying requirements. This configuration space is often modeled using Feature Models (FMs). However, in practice, the SPL (and consequently the FM) is often created after a set of variants has already been created manually. Automating the task of reverse engineering a feature model that describes a set of variants makes the process of adopting an SPL easier. The genetic programming pipeline is a good fit for feature models and has been shown to produce good reverse engineering results. In this paper, we replicate the results of such an existing approach with a larger set of feature models and investigate the effects of various genetic programming parameters and operators on the results. The design of our replication experiments employs three perspectives: duplicate the exact conditions using various features models, study the interaction of two parameters of the genetic programming approach, and optimize the values for the population and generation parameters and for the mutation and crossover operators. Results reinforce the previously obtained outcome, the original study being confirmed. The relations between the number of features and number of generations, respectively number of features and size of populations were also investigated and best values based on obtained results are provided. The current study also aimed to optimize various parameters of the genetic programming approach, the interpretation of those experiments discovering concrete values."
"Out of sight, out of mind? How vulnerable dependencies affect open-source projects","ContextSoftware developers often use open-source libraries in their project to improve development speed. However, such libraries may contain security vulnerabilities, and this has resulted in several high-profile incidents in recent years. As usage of open-source libraries grows, understanding of these dependency vulnerabilities becomes increasingly important.ObjectiveIn this work, we analyze vulnerabilities in open-source libraries used by 450 software projects written in Java, Python, and Ruby. Our goal is to examine types, distribution, severity, and persistence of the vulnerabilities, along with relationships between their prevalence and project as well as commit attributes.MethodOur data is obtained by scanning versions of the sample projects after each commit made between November 1, 2017 and October 31, 2018 using an industrial software composition analysis tool, which provides information such as library names and versions, dependency types (direct or transitive), and known vulnerabilities.ResultsAmong other findings, we found that project activity level, popularity, and developer experience do not translate into better or worse handling of dependency vulnerabilities. We also found “Denial of Service” and “Information Disclosure” types of vulnerabilities being common across the languages studied. Further, we found that most dependency vulnerabilities persist throughout the observation period (mean of 78.4%, 97.7%, and 66.4% for publicly-known vulnerabilities in our Java, Python, and Ruby datasets respectively), and the resolved ones take 3-5 months to fix.ConclusionOur results highlight the importance of managing the number of dependencies and performing timely updates, and indicate some areas that can be prioritized to improve security in wide range of projects, such as prevention and mitigation of Denial-of-Service attacks."
Embedding API dependency graph for neural code generation,"The problem of code generation from textual program descriptions has long been viewed as a grand challenge in software engineering. In recent years, many deep learning based approaches have been proposed, which can generate a sequence of code from a sequence of textual program description. However, the existing approaches ignore the global relationships among API methods, which are important for understanding the usage of APIs. In this paper, we propose to model the dependencies among API methods as an API dependency graph (ADG) and incorporate the graph embedding into a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model. In addition to the existing encoder-decoder structure, a new module named “embedder” is introduced. In this way, the decoder can utilize both global structural dependencies and textual program description to predict the target code. We conduct extensive code generation experiments on three public datasets and in two programming languages (Python and Java). Our proposed approach, called ADG-Seq2Seq, yields significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods and maintains its performance as the length of the target code increases. Extensive ablation tests show that the proposed ADG embedding is effective and outperforms the baselines."
Evaluating network embedding techniques’ performances in software bug prediction,"Software bug prediction techniques can be very helpful in testing and code inspection. Over the past decade, network measures have been successfully used in bug prediction. Following the same intuition, recently, researchers started using network embedding techniques in bug prediction. However, existing studies only evaluated the Skip-gram and CBOW models with random walk. Considering network embedding is a fast-developing research direction, it is important to evaluate other network embedding techniques’ performances in bug prediction. Moreover, existing studies have not investigated the application and performance of network embedding in effort-aware bug prediction, which is thought to be a more realistic scenario that evaluates the cost effectiveness of bug prediction models. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate network embedding algorithms in bug prediction by utilizing and extending node2defect, a newly proposed bug prediction model that combines the embedded vectors with traditional software engineering metrics through concatenation. Experiments are conducted based on seven network embedding algorithms, two effort-aware models, and 13 open-source Java systems. Experimental results show that node2defect outperforms traditional metrics by + 14.64% in terms of MCC score, and by + 7.51% to + 16.57% in effort-aware bug prediction. More interestingly, when combined with CBS + , the embedded vectors alone can achieve the best performance. Among different network embedding algorithms, the newly proposed algorithm ProNE has the best performance."
A first look at Android applications in Google Play related to COVID-19,"Due to the convenience of access-on-demand to information and business solutions, mobile apps have become an important asset in the digital world. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, app developers have joined the response effort in various ways by releasing apps that target different user bases (e.g., all citizens or journalists), offer different services (e.g., location tracking or diagnostic-aid), provide generic or specialized information, etc. While many apps have raised some concerns by spreading misinformation or even malware, the literature does not yet provide a clear landscape of the different apps that were developed. In this study, we focus on the Android ecosystem and investigate Covid-related Android apps. In a best-effort scenario, we attempt to systematically identify all relevant apps and study their characteristics with the objective to provide a first taxonomy of Covid-related apps, broadening the relevance beyond the implementation of contact tracing. Overall, our study yields a number of empirical insights that contribute to enlarge the knowledge on Covid-related apps: (1) Developer communities contributed rapidly to the COVID-19, with dedicated apps released as early as January 2020; (2) Covid-related apps deliver digital tools to users (e.g., health diaries), serve to broadcast information to users (e.g., spread statistics), and collect data from users (e.g., for tracing); (3) Covid-related apps are less complex than standard apps; (4) they generally do not seem to leak sensitive data; (5) in the majority of cases, Covid-related apps are released by entities with past experience on the market, mostly official government entities or public health organizations."
