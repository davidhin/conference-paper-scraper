GreenHub: a large-scale collaborative dataset to battery consumption analysis of android devices,"ContextThe development of solutions to improve battery life in Android smartphones and the energy efficiency of apps running on them is hindered by diversity. There are more than 24k Android smartphone models in the world. Moreover, there are multiple active operating system versions, and a myriad application usage profiles.ObjectiveIn such a high-diversity scenario, profiling for energy has only limited applicability. One would need to obtain information about energy use in real usage scenarios to make informed, effective decisions about energy optimization. The goal of our work is to understand how Android usage, apps, operating systems, hardware, and user habits influence battery lifespan.MethodWe leverage crowdsourcing to collect information about energy in real-world usage scenarios. This data is collected by a mobile app, which we developed and made available to the public through Google Play store, and periodically uploaded to a centralized server and made publicly available to researchers, app developers, and smartphone manufacturers through multiple channels (SQL, REST API, zipped CSV/Parquet dump).ResultsThis paper presents the results of a wide analysis of the tendency several smart-phone characteristics have on the battery charge/discharge rate, such as the different models, brands, networks, settings, applications, and even countries. Our analysis was performed over the crowdsourced data, and we have presented findings such as which applications tend to be around when battery consumption is the highest, do users from different countries have the same battery usage, and even showcase methods to help developers find and improve energy inefficient processes. The dataset we considered is sizable; it comprises 23+ million (anonymous) data samples stemming from a large number of installations of the mobile app. Moreover, it includes 700+ million data points pertaining to processes running on these devices. In addition, the dataset is diverse. It covers 1.6k+ device brands, 11.8k+ smartphone models, and more than 50 Android versions. We have been using this dataset to perform multiple analyses. For example, we studied what are the most common apps running on these smartphones and related the presence of those apps in memory with the battery discharge rate of these devices. We have also used this dataset in teaching, having had students practicing data analysis and machine learning techniques for relating energy consumption/charging rates with many other hardware and software qualities, attributes and user behaviors.ConclusionsThe dataset we considered can support studies with a wide range of research goals, be those energy efficiency or not. It opens the opportunity to inform and reshape user habits, and even influence the development of both hardware (manufacturers) and software (developers) for mobile devices. Our analysis also shows results which go outside of the common perception of what impacts battery consumption in real-world usage, while exposing new varied, complex, and promising research avenues."
A family of experiments on test-driven development,"Context:Test-driven development (TDD) is an agile software development approach that has been widely claimed to improve software quality. However, the extent to which TDD improves quality appears to be largely dependent upon the characteristics of the study in which it is evaluated (e.g., the research method, participant type, programming environment, etc.). The particularities of each study make the aggregation of results untenable.Objectives:The goal of this paper is to: increase the accuracy and generalizability of the results achieved in isolated experiments on TDD, provide joint conclusions on the performance of TDD across different industrial and academic settings, and assess the extent to which the characteristics of the experiments affect the quality-related performance of TDD.Method:We conduct a family of 12 experiments on TDD in academia and industry. We aggregate their results by means of meta-analysis. We perform exploratory analyses to identify variables impacting the quality-related performance of TDD.Results:TDD novices achieve a slightly higher code quality with iterative test-last development (i.e., ITL, the reverse approach of TDD) than with TDD. The task being developed largely determines quality. The programming environment, the order in which TDD and ITL are applied, or the learning effects from one development approach to another do not appear to affect quality. The quality-related performance of professionals using TDD drops more than for students. We hypothesize that this may be due to their being more resistant to change and potentially less motivated than students.Conclusion:Previous studies seem to provide conflicting results on TDD performance (i.e., positive vs. negative, respectively). We hypothesize that these conflicting results may be due to different study durations, experiment participants being unfamiliar with the TDD process, or case studies comparing the performance achieved by TDD vs. the control approach (e.g., the waterfall model), each applied to develop a different system. Further experiments with TDD experts are needed to validate these hypotheses."
An empirical study on changing leadership in agile teams,"An increasing number of companies aim to enable their development teams to work in an agile manner. When introducing agile teams, companies face several challenges. This paper explores the kind of leadership needed to support teams to work in an agile way. One theoretical agile leadership concept describes a Scrum Master who is supposed to empower the team to lead itself. Empirical findings on such a leadership role are controversial. We still have not understood how leadership unfolds in a team that is by definition self-organizing. Further exploration is needed to better understand leadership in agile teams. Our goal is to explore how leadership changes while the team matures using the example of the Scrum Master. Through a grounded theory study containing 75 practitioners from 11 divisions at the Robert Bosch GmbH we identified a set of nine leadership roles that are transferred from the Scrum Master to the Development Team while it matures. We uncovered that a leadership gap and a supportive internal team climate are enablers of the role transfer process, whereas role conflicts may diminish the role transfer. To make the Scrum Master change in a mature team, team members need to receive trust and freedom to take on a leadership role which was previously filled by the Scrum Master. We conclude with practical implications for managers, Product Owners, Development Teams and Scrum Masters which they can apply in real settings."
Ethical issues in empirical studies using student subjects: Re-visiting practices and perceptions,"ContextUsing student subjects in empirical studies has been discussed extensively from a methodological perspective in Software Engineering (SE), but there is a lack of similar discussion surrounding ethical aspects of doing so. As students are in a subordinate relationship to their instructors, such a discussion is needed.ObjectiveWe aim to increase the understanding of practices and perceptions SE researchers have of ethical issues with student participation in empirical studies.MethodWe conducted a systematic mapping study of 372 empirical SE studies involving students, following up with a survey answered by 100 SE researchers regarding their current practices and opinions regarding student participation.ResultsThe mapping study shows that the majority of studies does not report conditions regarding recruitment, voluntariness, compensation, and ethics approval. In contrast, the majority of survey participants supports reporting these conditions. The survey further reveals that less than half of the participants require ethics approval. Additionally, the majority of participants recruit their own students on a voluntary basis, and use informed consent with withdrawal options. There is disagreement among the participants whether course instructors should be involved in research studies and if they should know who participates in a study.ConclusionsIt is a positive sign that mandatory participation is rare, and that informed consent and withdrawal options are standard. However, we see immediate need for action, as study conditions are under-reported, and as opinions on ethical practices differ widely. In particular, there is little regard in SE on the power relationship between instructors and students."
From one to hundreds: multi-licensing in the JavaScript ecosystem,"Open source licenses create a legal framework that plays a crucial role in the widespread adoption of open source projects. Without a license, any source code available on the internet could not be openly (re)distributed. Although recent studies provide evidence that most popular open source projects have a license, developers might lack confidence or expertise when they need to combine software licenses, leading to a mistaken project license unification. This license usage is challenged by the high degree of reuse that occurs in the heart of modern software development practices, in which third-party libraries and frameworks are easily and quickly integrated into a software codebase. This scenario creates what we call “multi-licensed” projects, which happens when one project has components that are licensed under more than one license. Although these components exist at the file-level, they naturally impact licensing decisions at the project-level. In this paper, we conducted a mix-method study to shed some light on these questions. We started by parsing 1,426,263 (source code and non-source code) files available on 1,552 JavaScript projects, looking for license information. Among these projects, we observed that 947 projects (61%) employ more than one license. On average, there are 4.7 licenses per studied project (max: 256). Among the reasons for multi-licensing is to incorporate the source code of third-party libraries into the project’s codebase. When doing so, we observed that 373 of the multi-licensed projects introduced at least one license incompatibility issue. We also surveyed with 83 maintainers of these projects aimed to cross-validate our findings. We observed that 63% of the surveyed maintainers are not aware of the multi-licensing implications. For those that are aware, they adopt multiple licenses mostly to conform with third-party libraries’ licenses."
A privacy and security analysis of early-deployed COVID-19 contact tracing Android apps,"As this article is being drafted, the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic is causing harm and disruption across the world. Many countries aimed at supporting their contact tracers with the use of digital contact tracing apps in order to manage and control the spread of the virus. Their idea is the automatic registration of meetings between smartphone owners for the quicker processing of infection chains. To date, there are many contact tracing apps that have already been launched and used in 2020. There has been a lot of speculations about the privacy and security aspects of these apps and their potential violation of data protection principles. Therefore, the developers of these apps are constantly criticized because of undermining users’ privacy, neglecting essential privacy and security requirements, and developing apps under time pressure without considering privacy- and security-by-design. In this study, we analyze the privacy and security performance of 28 contact tracing apps available on Android platform from various perspectives, including their code’s privileges, promises made in their privacy policies, and static and dynamic performances. Our methodology is based on the collection of various types of data concerning these 28 apps, namely permission requests, privacy policy texts, run-time resource accesses, and existing security vulnerabilities. Based on the analysis of these data, we quantify and assess the impact of these apps on users’ privacy. We aimed at providing a quick and systematic inspection of the earliest contact tracing apps that have been deployed on multiple continents. Our findings have revealed that the developers of these apps need to take more cautionary steps to ensure code quality and to address security and privacy vulnerabilities. They should more consciously follow legal requirements with respect to apps’ permission declarations, privacy principles, and privacy policy contents."
Appreciation to Empirical Software Engineering reviewers of 2020,
An empirical investigation of organic software product lines,"Software product line engineering is a best practice for managing reuse in families of software systems that is increasingly being applied to novel and emerging domains. In this work we investigate the use of software product line engineering in one of these new domains, synthetic biology. In synthetic biology living organisms are programmed to perform new functions or improve existing functions. These programs are designed and constructed using small building blocks made out of DNA. We conjecture that there are families of products that consist of common and variable DNA parts, and we can leverage product line engineering to help synthetic biologists build, evolve, and reuse DNA parts. In this paper we perform an investigation of domain engineering that leverages an open-source repository of more than 45,000 reusable DNA parts. We show the feasibility of these new types of product line models by identifying features and related artifacts in up to 93.5% of products, and that there is indeed both commonality and variability. We then construct feature models for four commonly engineered functions leading to product lines ranging from 10 to 7.5 × 1020 products. In a case study we demonstrate how we can use the feature models to help guide new experimentation in aspects of application engineering. Finally, in an empirical study we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of automated reverse engineering on both complete and incomplete sets of products. In the process of these studies, we highlight key challenges and uncovered limitations of existing SPL techniques and tools which provide a roadmap for making SPL engineering applicable to new and emerging domains."
Are datasets for information retrieval-based bug localization techniques trustworthy?,"Various evaluation datasets are used to evaluate the performance of information retrieval-based bug localization (IRBL) techniques. To accurately evaluate the IRBL and furthermore improve the performance, it is strongly required to analyze the validity of these datasets in advance. To this end, we surveyed 50 previous studies, collected 41,754 bug reports, and found out critical problems that affect the validity of results of performance evaluation. They are in both the ground truth and the search space. These problems arise from using different bug types without clearly distinguishing them. We divided the bugs into production- and test-related bugs. Based on this distinction, we investigate and analyze the impact of the bug type on IRBL performance evaluation. Approximately 18.6% of the bug reports were linked to non-buggy files as the ground truth. Up to 58.5% of the source files in the search space introduced noise into the localization of a specific bug type. From the experiments, we validated that the average precision changed in approximately 90% of the bug reports linked with an incorrect ground truth; we determined that specifying a suitable search space changed the average precision in at least half of the bug reports. Further, we showed that these problems can alter the relative ranks of the IRBL techniques. Our large-scale analysis demonstrated that a significant amount of noise occurs, which can compromise the evaluation results. An important finding of this study is that it is essential to consider the bug types to improve the accuracy of the performance evaluation."
Release synchronization in software ecosystems,"Software ecosystems bring value by integrating software projects related to a given domain, such as Linux distributions integrating upstream open-source projects or the Android ecosystem for mobile Apps. Since each project within an ecosystem may potentially have its release cycle and roadmap, this creates an enormous burden for users who must expend the effort to identify and install compatible project releases from the ecosystem manually. Thus, many ecosystems, such as the Linux distributions, take it upon them to release a polished, well-integrated product to the end-user. However, the body of knowledge lacks empirical evidence about the coordination and synchronization efforts needed at the ecosystem level to ensure such federated releases. This paper empirically studies the strategies used to synchronize releases of ecosystem projects in the context of the OpenStack ecosystem, in which a central release team manages the six-month release cycle of the overall OpenStack ecosystem product. We use qualitative analysis on the release team’s IRC-meeting logs that comprise two OpenStack releases (one-year long). Thus, we identified, cataloged, and documented ten major release synchronization activities, which we further validated through interviews with eight active OpenStack senior practitioners (members of either the release team or project teams). Our results suggest that even though an ecosystem’s power lies in the interaction of inter-dependent projects, release synchronization remains a challenge for both the release team and the project teams. Moreover, we found evidence (and reasons) of multiple release strategies co-existing within a complex ecosystem."

An automated framework for the extraction of semantic legal metadata from legal texts,"Semantic legal metadata provides information that helps with understanding and interpreting legal provisions. Such metadata is therefore important for the systematic analysis of legal requirements. However, manually enhancing a large legal corpus with semantic metadata is prohibitively expensive. Our work is motivated by two observations: (1) the existing requirements engineering (RE) literature does not provide a harmonized view on the semantic metadata types that are useful for legal requirements analysis; (2) automated support for the extraction of semantic legal metadata is scarce, and it does not exploit the full potential of artificial intelligence technologies, notably natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Our objective is to take steps toward overcoming these limitations. To do so, we review and reconcile the semantic legal metadata types proposed in the RE literature. Subsequently, we devise an automated extraction approach for the identified metadata types using NLP and ML. We evaluate our approach through two case studies over the Luxembourgish legislation. Our results indicate a high accuracy in the generation of metadata annotations. In particular, in the two case studies, we were able to obtain precision scores of 97,2% and 82,4%, and recall scores of 94,9% and 92,4%."
Revisiting the VCCFinder approach for the identification of vulnerability-contributing commits,"Detecting vulnerabilities in software is a constant race between development teams and potential attackers. While many static and dynamic approaches have focused on regularly analyzing the software in its entirety, a recent research direction has focused on the analysis of changes that are applied to the code. VCCFinder is a seminal approach in the literature that builds on machine learning to automatically detect whether an incoming commit will introduce some vulnerabilities. Given the influence of VCCFinder in the literature, we undertake an investigation into its performance as a state-of-the-art system. To that end, we propose to attempt a replication study on the VCCFinder supervised learning approach. The insights of our failure to replicate the results reported in the original publication informed the design of a new approach to identify vulnerability-contributing commits based on a semi-supervised learning technique with an alternate feature set. We provide all artefacts and a clear description of this approach as a new reproducible baseline for advancing research on machine learning-based identification of vulnerability-introducing commits."
A comprehensive study of bloated dependencies in the Maven ecosystem,"Build automation tools and package managers have a profound influence on software development. They facilitate the reuse of third-party libraries, support a clear separation between the application’s code and its external dependencies, and automate several software development tasks. However, the wide adoption of these tools introduces new challenges related to dependency management. In this paper, we propose an original study of one such challenge: the emergence of bloated dependencies. Bloated dependencies are libraries that are packaged with the application’s compiled code but that are actually not necessary to build and run the application. They artificially grow the size of the built binary and increase maintenance effort. We propose DepClean, a tool to determine the presence of bloated dependencies in Maven artifacts. We analyze 9,639 Java artifacts hosted on Maven Central, which include a total of 723,444 dependency relationships. Our key result is as follows: 2.7% of the dependencies directly declared are bloated, 15.4% of the inherited dependencies are bloated, and 57% of the transitive dependencies of the studied artifacts are bloated. In other words, it is feasible to reduce the number of dependencies of Maven artifacts to 1/4 of its current count. Our qualitative assessment with 30 notable open-source projects indicates that developers pay attention to their dependencies when they are notified of the problem. They are willing to remove bloated dependencies: 21/26 answered pull requests were accepted and merged by developers, removing 140 dependencies in total: 75 direct and 65 transitive."
"Lags in the release, adoption, and propagation of npm vulnerability fixes","Security vulnerability in third-party dependencies is a growing concern not only for developers of the affected software, but for the risks it poses to an entire software ecosystem, e.g., Heartbleed vulnerability. Recent studies show that developers are slow to respond to the threat of vulnerability, sometimes taking four to eleven months to act. To ensure quick adoption and propagation of a release that contains the fix (fixing release), we conduct an empirical investigation to identify lags that may occur between the vulnerable release and its fixing release (package-side fixing release). Through a preliminary study of 231 package-side fixing release of npm projects on GitHub, we observe that a fixing release is rarely released on its own, with up to 85.72% of the bundled commits being unrelated to a fix. We then compare the package-side fixing release with changes on a client-side (client-side fixing release). Through an empirical study of the adoption and propagation tendencies of 1,290 package-side fixing releases that impact throughout a network of 1,553,325 releases of npm packages, we find that stale clients require additional migration effort, even if the package-side fixing release was quick (i.e., package-side fixing releasetypeSpatch). Furthermore, we show the influence of factors such as the branch that the package-side fixing release lands on and the severity of vulnerability on its propagation. In addition to these lags we identify and characterize, this paper lays the groundwork for future research on how to mitigate propagation lags in an ecosystem."
Understanding large-scale software systems – structure and flows,"Program comprehension accounts for a large portion of software development costs and effort. The academic literature contains mainly research on program comprehension of short code snippets, but comprehension at the system level is no less important. We claim that comprehending a software system is a distinct activity that differs from code comprehension. We interviewed experienced developers, architects, and managers in the software industry and open-source community, to uncover the meaning of program comprehension at the system level; later we conducted a survey to verify the findings. The interviews demonstrate, among other things, that system comprehension is largely detached from code and programming language, and includes scope that is not captured in the code. It focuses on one hand on the structure of the system, and on the other hand on the flows in the system, but less on the code itself. System comprehension is a continuous, unending, iterative process, which utilizes white-box and black-box approaches at different layers of the system depending on needs, and combines both bottom-up and top-down comprehension strategies. In summary, comprehending a system is not just comprehending the code at a larger scale, and it is not possible to comprehend large systems at the same level as comprehending code."
Correction to: An empirical assessment of baseline feature location techniques,
Locating faults with program slicing: an empirical analysis,"Statistical fault localization is an easily deployed technique for quickly determining candidates for faulty code locations. If a human programmer has to search the fault beyond the top candidate locations, though, more traditional techniques of following dependencies along dynamic slices may be better suited. In a large study of 457 bugs (369 single faults and 88 multiple faults) in 46 open source C programs, we compare the effectiveness of statistical fault localization against dynamic slicing. For single faults, we find that dynamic slicing was eight percentage points more effective than the best performing statistical debugging formula; for 66% of the bugs, dynamic slicing finds the fault earlier than the best performing statistical debugging formula. In our evaluation, dynamic slicing is more effective for programs with single fault, but statistical debugging performs better on multiple faults. Best results, however, are obtained by a hybrid approach: If programmers first examine at most the top five most suspicious locations from statistical debugging, and then switch to dynamic slices, on average, they will need to examine 15% (30 lines) of the code. These findings hold for 18 most effective statistical debugging formulas and our results are independent of the number of faults (i.e. single or multiple faults) and error type (i.e. artificial or real errors)."
Training students in evidence-based software engineering and systematic reviews: a systematic review and empirical study,"ContextAlthough influential in academia, evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) has had little impact on industry practice. We found that other disciplines have identified lack of training as a significant barrier to Evidence-Based Practice.ObjectiveTo build and assess an EBSE training proposal suitable for students with more than 3 years of computer science/software engineering university-level training.MethodWe performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of EBSE teaching initiatives and used the SLR results to help us to develop and evaluate an EBSE training proposal. The course was based on the theory of learning outcomes and incorporated a large practical content related to performing an SLR. We ran the course with 10 students and based course evaluation on student performance and opinions of both students and teachers. We assessed knowledge of EBSE principles from the mid-term and final tests, as well as evaluating the SLRs produced by the student teams. We solicited student opinions about the course and its value via a student survey, a team survey, and a focus group. The teachers’ viewpoint was collected in a debriefing meeting.ResultsOur SLR identified 14 relevant primary studies. The primary studies emphasized the importance of practical examples (usually based on the SLR process) and used a variety of evaluation methods, but lacked any formal education methodology. We identified 54 learning outcomes covering aspects of EBSE and the SLR method. All 10 students passed the course. Our course evaluation showed that a large percentage of the learning outcomes established for training were accomplished.ConclusionsThe course proved suitable for students to understand the EBSE paradigm and to be able to apply it to a limited-scope practical assignment. Our learning outcomes, course structure, and course evaluation process should help to improve the effectiveness and comparability of future studies of EBSE training. However, future courses should increase EBSE training related to the use of SLR results."
Testing self-healing cyber-physical systems under uncertainty with reinforcement learning: an empirical study,"Self-healing is becoming an essential feature of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). CPSs with this feature are named Self-Healing CPSs (SH-CPSs). SH-CPSs detect and recover from errors caused by hardware or software faults at runtime and handle uncertainties arising from their interactions with environments. Therefore, it is critical to test if SH-CPSs can still behave as expected under uncertainties. By testing an SH-CPS in various conditions and learning from testing results, reinforcement learning algorithms can gradually optimize their testing policies and apply the policies to detect failures, i.e., cases that the SH-CPS fails to behave as expected. However, there is insufficient evidence to know which reinforcement learning algorithms perform the best in terms of testing SH-CPSs behaviors including their self-healing behaviors under uncertainties. To this end, we conducted an empirical study to evaluate the performance of 14 combinations of reinforcement learning algorithms, with two value function learning based methods for operation invocations and seven policy optimization based algorithms for introducing uncertainties. Experimental results reveal that the 14 combinations of the algorithms achieved similar coverage of system states and transitions, and the combination of Q-learning and Uncertainty Policy Optimization (UPO) detected the most failures among the 14 combinations. On average, the Q-Learning and UPO combination managed to discover two times more failures than the others. Meanwhile, the combination took 52% less time to find a failure. Regarding scalability, the time and space costs of the value function learning based methods grow, as the number of states and transitions of the system under test increases. In contrast, increasing the system’s complexity has little impact on policy optimization based algorithms."
Improving energy-efficiency by recommending Java collections,"Over the last years, increasing attention has been given to creating energy-efficient software systems. However, developers still lack the knowledge and the tools to support them in that task. In this work, we explore our vision that non-specialists can build software that consumes less energy by alternating diversely-designed pieces of software without increasing the development complexity. To support our vision, we propose an approach for energy-aware development that combines the construction of application-independent energy profiles of Java collections and static analysis to produce an estimate of in which ways and how intensively a system employs these collections. We implement this approach in a tool named CT+ that works with both desktop and mobile Java systems and is capable of analyzing 39 different collection implementations of lists, maps, and sets. We applied CT+ to seventeen software systems: two mobile-based, twelve desktop-based, and three that can run in both environments. Our evaluation infrastructure involved a high-end server, two notebooks, three smartphones, and a tablet. Overall, 2295 recommendations were applied, achieving up to 16.34% reduction in energy consumption, usually changing a single line of code per recommendation. Even for a real-world, mature system such as Tomcat, CT+ could achieve a 4.12% reduction in energy consumption. Our results indicate that some widely used collections, e.g., ArrayList, HashMap, and Hashtable, are not energy- efficient and sometimes should be avoided when energy consumption is a major concern."
How to Better Distinguish Security Bug Reports (Using Dual Hyperparameter Optimization),"BackgroundIn order that the general public is not vulnerable to hackers, security bug reports need to be handled by small groups of engineers before being widely discussed. But learning how to distinguish the security bug reports from other bug reports is challenging since they may occur rarely. Data mining methods that can find such scarce targets require extensive optimization effort.GoalThe goal of this research is to aid practitioners as they struggle to optimize methods that try to distinguish between rare security bug reports and other bug reports.MethodOur proposed method, called SWIFT, is a dual optimizer that optimizes both learner and pre-processor options. Since this is a large space of options, SWIFT uses a technique called 𝜖-dominance that learns how to avoid operations that do not significantly improve performance.ResultWhen compared to recent state-of-the-art results (from FARSEC which is published in TSE’18), we find that the SWIFT’s dual optimization of both pre-processor and learner is more useful than optimizing each of them individually. For example, in a study of security bug reports from the Chromium dataset, the median recalls of FARSEC and SWIFT were 15.7% and 77.4%, respectively. For another example, in experiments with data from the Ambari project, the median recalls improved from 21.5% to 85.7% (FARSEC to SWIFT).ConclusionOverall, our approach can quickly optimize models that achieve better recalls than the prior state-of-the-art. These increases in recall are associated with moderate increases in false positive rates (from 8% to 24%, median). For future work, these results suggest that dual optimization is both practical and useful."
Flair: efficient analysis of Android inter-component vulnerabilities in response to incremental changes,"Inter-component communication (ICC) among Android apps is shown to be the source of many security vulnerabilities. Prior research has developed compositional analyses to detect the existence of ICC vulnerabilities in a set of installed apps. However, they all lack the ability to efficiently respond to incremental system changes—such as adding/removing apps. Every time the system changes, the entire analysis has to be repeated, making them too expensive for practical use, given the frequency with which apps are updated, installed, and removed on a typical Android device. This paper presents a novel technique, dubbed FLAIR, for efficient, yet formally precise, security analysis of Android apps in response to incremental system changes. Leveraging the fact that the changes are likely to impact only a small fraction of the prior analysis results, FLAIR recomputes the analysis only where required, thereby greatly improving analysis performance without sacrificing the soundness and completeness thereof. Our experimental results using numerous collections of real-world apps corroborate that FLAIR can provide an order of magnitude speedup over prior techniques."
Learning to recognize actionable static code warnings (is intrinsically easy),"Static code warning tools often generate warnings that programmers ignore. Such tools can be made more useful via data mining algorithms that select the “actionable” warnings; i.e. the warnings that are usually not ignored. In this paper, we look for actionable warnings within a sample of 5,675 actionable warnings seen in 31,058 static code warnings from FindBugs. We find that data mining algorithms can find actionable warnings with remarkable ease. Specifically, a range of data mining methods (deep learners, random forests, decision tree learners, and support vector machines) all achieved very good results (recalls and AUC(TRN, TPR) measures usually over 95% and false alarms usually under 5%). Given that all these learners succeeded so easily, it is appropriate to ask if there is something about this task that is inherently easy. We report that while our data sets have up to 58 raw features, those features can be approximated by less than two underlying dimensions. For such intrinsically simple data, many different kinds of learners can generate useful models with similar performance. Based on the above, we conclude that learning to recognize actionable static code warnings is easy, using a wide range of learning algorithms, since the underlying data is intrinsically simple. If we had to pick one particular learner for this task, we would suggest linear SVMs (since, at least in our sample, that learner ran relatively quickly and achieved the best median performance) and we would not recommend deep learning (since this data is intrinsically very simple)."
The nature of build changes,"Build systems are an essential part of modern software projects. As software projects change continuously, it is crucial to understand how the build system changes because neglecting its maintenance can, at best, lead to expensive build breakage, or at worst, introduce user-reported defects due to incorrectly compiled, linked, packaged, or deployed official releases. Recent studies have investigated the (co-)evolution of build configurations and reasons for build breakage; however, the prior analysis focused on a coarse-grained outcome (i.e., either build changing or not). In this paper, we present BuildDiff, an approach to extract detailed build changes from Maven build files and classify them into 143 change types. In a manual evaluation of 400 build-changing commits, we show that BuildDiff can extract and classify build changes with average precision, recall, and f1-scores of 0.97, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively. We then present two studies using the build changes extracted from 144 open source Java projects to study the frequency and time of build changes. The results show that the top-10 most frequent change types account for 51% of the build changes. Among them, changes to version numbers and changes to dependencies of the projects occur most frequently. We also observe frequently co-occurring changes, such as changes to the source code management definitions, and corresponding changes to the dependency management system and the dependency declaration. Furthermore, our results show that build changes frequently occur around release days. In particular, critical changes, such as updates to plugin configuration parts and dependency insertions, are performed before a release day. The contributions of this paper lay in the foundation for future research, such as for analyzing the (co-)evolution of build files with other artifacts, improving effort estimation approaches by incorporating necessary modifications to the build system specification, or automatic repair approaches for configuration code. Furthermore, our detailed change information enables improvements of refactoring approaches for build configurations and improvements of prediction models to identify error-prone build files."
