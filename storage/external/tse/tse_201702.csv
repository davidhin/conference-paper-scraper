ARENA: An Approach for the Automated Generation of Release Notes,"Abstract Release notes document corrections, enhancements, and, in general, changes that were implemented in a new release of a software project. They are usually created manually and may include hundreds of different items, such as descriptions of new features, bug fixes, structural changes, new or deprecated APIs, and changes to software licenses. Thus, producing them can be a time-consuming and daunting task. This paper describes ARENA (Automatic RElease Notes generAtor), an approach for the automatic generation of release notes. ARENA extracts changes from the source code, summarizes them, and integrates them with information from versioning systems and issue trackers. ARENA was designed based on the manual analysis of 990 existing release notes. In order to evaluate the quality of the release notes automatically generated by ARENA, we performed four empirical studies involving a total of 56 participants (48 professional developers and eight students). The obtained results indicate that the generated release notes are very good approximations of the ones manually produced by developers and often include important information that is missing in the manually created release notes.Keywords Libraries, Licenses, Feature Extraction, Documentation, Computer Bugs, Open Source Software, Software Evolution, Release Notes, Software Documentation"
A Study of Causes and Consequences of Client-Side JavaScript Bugs,"Abstract Client-side JavaScript is widely used in web applications to improve user-interactivity and minimize client-server communications. Unfortunately, JavaScript is known to be error-prone. While prior studies have demonstrated the prevalence of JavaScript faults, no attempts have been made to determine their causes and consequences. The goal of our study is to understand the root causes and impact of JavaScript faults and how the results can impact JavaScript programmers, testers and tool developers. We perform an empirical study of 502 bug reports from 19 bug repositories. The bug reports are thoroughly examined to classify and extract information about each bug' cause (the error) and consequence (the failure and impact). Our results show that the majority (68 percent) of JavaScript faults are DOM-related, meaning they are caused by faulty interactions of the JavaScript code with the Document Object Model (DOM). Further, 80 percent of the highest impact JavaScript faults are DOM-related. Finally, most JavaScript faults originate from programmer mistakes committed in the JavaScript code itself, as opposed to other web application components. These results indicate that JavaScript programmers and testers need tools that can help them reason about the DOM. Additionally, developers can use the error patterns we found to design more powerful static analysis tools for JavaScript.Keywords Computer Bugs, Servers, Market Research, HTML, Data Mining, Reliability, Cascading Style Sheets, Empirical Study, Faults, Java Script, Document Object Model DOM, Bug Reports"
Automated Synthesis and Dynamic Analysis of Tradeoff Spaces for Object-Relational Mapping,"Abstract Producing software systems that achieve acceptable tradeoffs among multiple non-functional properties remains a significant engineering problem. We propose an approach to solving this problem that combines synthesis of spaces of design alternatives from logical specifications and dynamic analysis of each point in the resulting spaces. We hypothesize that this approach has potential to help engineers understand important tradeoffs among dynamically measurable properties of system components at meaningful scales within reach of existing synthesis tools. To test this hypothesis, we developed tools to enable, and we conducted, a set of experiments in the domain of relational databases for object-oriented data models. For each of several data models, we used our approach to empirically test the accuracy of a published suite of metrics to predict tradeoffs based on the static schema structure alone. The results show that exhaustive synthesis and analysis provides a superior view of the tradeoff spaces for such designs. This work creates a path forward toward systems that achieve significantly better tradeoffs among important system properties.Keywords Data Models, Load Modeling, Object Oriented Modeling, Semantics, Relational Databases, Measurement, Relational Logic, Specification Driven Synthesis, Tradespace Analysis, ORM, Static Analysis, Dynamic Analysis"
DECAF: A Platform-Neutral Whole-System Dynamic Binary Analysis Platform,"Abstract Dynamic binary analysis is a prevalent and indispensable technique in program analysis. While several dynamic binary analysis tools and frameworks have been proposed, all suffer from one or more of: prohibitive performance degradation, a semantic gap between the analysis code and the program being analyzed, architecture/OS specificity, being user-mode only, and lacking APIs. We present DECAF, a virtual machine based, multi-target, whole-system dynamic binary analysis framework built on top of QEMU. DECAF provides Just-In-Time Virtual Machine Introspection and a plugin architecture with a simple-to-use event-driven programming interface. DECAF implements a new instruction-level taint tracking engine at bit granularity, which exercises fine control over the QEMU Tiny Code Generator (TCG) intermediate representation to accomplish on-the-fly optimizations while ensuring that the taint propagation is sound and highly precise. We perform a formal analysis of DECAF's taint propagation rules to verify that most instructions introduce neither false positives nor false negatives. We also present three platform-neutral pluginsâ€”Instruction Tracer, Keylogger Detector, and API Tracer, to demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of DECAF in writing cross-platform and system-wide analysis tools. Implementation of DECAF consists of 9,550 lines of C++ code and 10,270 lines of C code and we evaluate DECAF using CPU2006 SPEC benchmarks and show average overhead of 605 percent for system wide tainting and 12 percent for VMI.Keywords Instruments, Virtual Machining, Kernel, Semantics, Computer Architecture, Registers, Context, Virtual Machine Introspection, Dynamic Binary Analysis, Dynamic Taint Analysis"
How Social and Communication Channels Shape and Challenge a Participatory Culture in Software Development,"Abstract Software developers use many different communication tools and channels in their work. The diversity of these tools has dramatically increased over the past decade and developers now have access to a wide range of socially enabled communication channels and social media to support their activities. The availability of such social tools is leading to a participatory culture of software development, where developers want to engage with, learn from, and co-create software with other developers. However, the interplay of these social channels, as well as the opportunities and challenges they may create when used together within this participatory development culture are not yet well understood. In this paper, we report on a large-scale survey conducted with 1,449 GitHub users. We discuss the channels these developers find essential to their work and gain an understanding of the challenges they face using them. Our findings lay the empirical foundation for providing recommendations to developers and tool designers on how to use and improve tools for software developers.Keywords Software, Communication Channels, Media, Collaboration, Electronic Mail, Face, Knowledge Engineering, Software Engineering, Participatory Culture, Communication, Social Media, CSCW"
