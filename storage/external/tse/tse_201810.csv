A Theoretical and Empirical Study of Diversity-Aware Mutation Adequacy Criterion,"Abstract Diversity has been widely studied in software testing as a guidance towards effective sampling of test inputs in the vast space of possible program behaviors. However, diversity has received relatively little attention in mutation testing. The traditional mutation adequacy criterion is a one-dimensional measure of the total number of killed mutants. We propose a novel, diversity-aware mutation adequacy criterion called distinguishing mutation adequacy criterion, which is fully satisfied when each of the considered mutants can be identified by the set of tests that kill it, thereby encouraging inclusion of more diverse range of tests. This paper presents the formal definition of the distinguishing mutation adequacy and its score. Subsequently, an empirical study investigates the relationship among distinguishing mutation score, fault detection capability, and test suite size. The results show that the distinguishing mutation adequacy criterion detects 1.33 times more unseen faults than the traditional mutation adequacy criterion, at the cost of a 1.56 times increase in test suite size, for adequate test suites that fully satisfies the criteria. The results show a better picture for inadequate test suites; on average, 8.63 times more unseen faults are detected at the cost of a 3.14 times increase in test suite size.Keywords Fault Detection, Software Engineering, Software Testing, Correlation, Indexes, Subspace Constraints, Mutation Testing, Test Adequacy Criteria, Diversity"
Coordination Challenges in Large-Scale Software Development: A Case Study of Planning Misalignment in Hybrid Settings,"Abstract Achieving effective inter-team coordination is one of the most pressing challenges in large-scale software development. Hybrid approaches of traditional and agile development promise combining the overview and predictability of long-term planning on an inter-team level with the flexibility and adaptability of agile development on a team level. It is currently unclear, however, why such hybrids often fail. Our case study within a large software development unit of 13 teams at a global enterprise software company explores how and why a combination of traditional planning on an inter-team level and agile development on a team level can result in ineffective coordination. Based on a variety of data, including interviews with scrum masters, product owners, architects and senior management, and using Grounded Theory data analysis procedures, we identify a lack of dependency awareness across development teams as a key explanation of ineffective coordination. Our findings show how a lack of dependency awareness emerges from misaligned planning activities of specification, prioritization, estimation and allocation between agile team and traditional inter-team levels and ultimately prevents effective coordination. Knowing about these issues, large-scale hybrid projects in similar contexts can try to better align their planning activities across levels to improve dependency awareness and in turn achieve more effective coordination.Keywords Software, Planning, Agile Software Development, Companies, Task Analysis, Interviews, Large Scale Software Development, Agile, Hybrid, Inter Team Coordination, Dependency Awareness, Planning Alignment, Information Systems Development"
Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with Professionals,"Abstract During software development and maintenance, developers spend a considerable amount of time on program comprehension activities. Previous studies show that program comprehension takes up as much as half of a developer's time. However, most of these studies are performed in a controlled setting, or with a small number of participants, and investigate the program comprehension activities only within the IDEs. However, developers' program comprehension activities go well beyond their IDE interactions. In this paper, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We follow Minelli et al.'s approach to assign developers' activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. We then measure the comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension, e.g., inspecting console and breakpoints in IDE, or reading and understanding tutorials in web browsers. Using this approach, we can perform a more realistic investigation of program comprehension activities, through a field study of program comprehension in practice across a total of seven real projects, on 78 professional developers, and amounting to 3,148 working hours. Our study leverages interaction data that is collected across many applications by the developers. Our study finds that on average developers spend ~58 percent of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers' experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension, and we find senior developers spend significantly less percentages of time on program comprehension than junior developers. Our study also highlights the importance of several research directions needed to reduce program comprehension time, e.g., building automatic detection and improvement of low quality code and documentation, construction of software-engineering-specific search engines, designing better IDEs that help developers navigate code and browse information more efficiently, etc.Keywords Human Computer Interaction, Internet, Program Compilers, Reverse Engineering, Search Engines, Software Maintenance, Program Comprehension Activities, Program Comprehension Time, Developers Time, Software Development, Software Maintenance, IDE Interactions, Activity Space Framework, Human Computer Interaction, Web Browsers, Programming Language, Project Phase, Software Engineering, Search Engines, Navigation, Software, Time Measurement, Browsers, Maintenance Engineering, Programming, Debugging, Program Comprehension, Field Study, Inference Model"
The Scent of a Smell: An Extensive Comparison Between Textual and Structural Smells,"Abstract Code smells are symptoms of poor design or implementation choices that have a negative effect on several aspects of software maintenance and evolution, such as program comprehension or change- and fault-proneness. This is why researchers have spent a lot of effort on devising methods that help developers to automatically detect them in source code. Almost all the techniques presented in literature are based on the analysis of structural properties extracted from source code, although alternative sources of information (e.g., textual analysis) for code smell detection have also been recently investigated. Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that code smells detected by existing tools based on the analysis of structural properties are generally ignored (and thus not refactored) by the developers. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether code smells detected using textual analysis are perceived and refactored by developers in the same or different way than code smells detected through structural analysis. To this aim, we set up two different experiments. We have first carried out a software repository mining study to analyze how developers act on textually or structurally detected code smells. Subsequently, we have conducted a user study with industrial developers and quality experts in order to qualitatively analyze how they perceive code smells identified using the two different sources of information. Results indicate that textually detected code smells are easier to identify and for this reason they are considered easier to refactor with respect to code smells detected using structural properties. On the other hand, the latter are often perceived as more severe, but more difficult to exactly identify and remove.Keywords Tools, Data Mining, Software Systems, Detectors, Maintenance Engineering, Large Scale Integration, Code Smells, Empirical Study, Mining Software Repositories"
Two-Phase Assessment Approach to Improve the Efficiency of Refactoring Identification,"Abstract To automate the refactoring identification process, a large number of candidates need to be compared. Such an overhead can make the refactoring approach impractical if the software size is large and the computational load of a fitness function is substantial. In this paper, we propose a two-phase assessment approach to improving the efficiency of the process. For each iteration of the refactoring process, refactoring candidates are preliminarily assessed using a lightweight, fast delta assessment method called the Delta Table. Using multiple Delta Tables, candidates to be evaluated with a fitness function are selected. A refactoring can be selected either interactively by the developer or automatically by choosing the best refactoring, and the refactorings are applied one after another in a stepwise fashion. The Delta Table is the key concept enabling a two-phase assessment approach because of its ability to quickly calculate the varying amounts of maintainability provided by each refactoring candidate. Our approach has been evaluated for three large-scale open-source projects. The results convincingly show that the proposed approach is efficient because it saves a considerable time while still achieving the same amount of fitness improvement as the approach examining all possible candidates.Keywords Measurement, Couplings, Symmetric Matrices, Open Source Software, Computational Efficiency, System Analysis And Design, Refactoring Assessment, Refactoring Identification, Maintainability Improvement"
