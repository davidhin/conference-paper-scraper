An Empirical Comparison of Model Validation Techniques for Defect Prediction Models,"Abstract Defect prediction models help software quality assurance teams to allocate their limited resources to the most defect-prone modules. Model validation techniques, such as k k -fold cross-validation, use historical data to estimate how well a model will perform in the future. However, little is known about how accurate the estimates of model validation techniques tend to be. In this paper, we investigate the bias and variance of model validation techniques in the domain of defect prediction. Analysis of 101 public defect datasets suggests that 77 percent of them are highly susceptible to producing unstable results– - selecting an appropriate model validation technique is a critical experimental design choice. Based on an analysis of 256 studies in the defect prediction literature, we select the 12 most commonly adopted model validation techniques for evaluation. Through a case study of 18 systems, we find that single-repetition holdout validation tends to produce estimates with 46-229 percent more bias and 53-863 percent more variance than the top-ranked model validation techniques. On the other hand, out-of-sample bootstrap validation yields the best balance between the bias and variance of estimates in the context of our study. Therefore, we recommend that future defect prediction studies avoid single-repetition holdout validation, and instead, use out-of-sample bootstrap validation.Keywords Predictive Models, Data Models, Analytical Models, Context, Context Modeling, Software, Logistics, Holdout Validation, Defect Prediction Models, Model Validation Techniques, Bootstrap Validation, Cross Validation"
Interaction Models and Automated Control under Partial Observable Environments,"Abstract The problem of automatically constructing a software component such that when executed in a given environment satisfies a goal, is recurrent in software engineering. Controller synthesis is a field which fits into this vision. In this paper we study controller synthesis for partially observable LTS models. We exploit the link between partially observable control and non-determinism and show that, unlike fully observable LTS or Kripke structure control problems, in this setting the existence of a solution depends on the interaction model between the controller-to-be and its environment. We identify two interaction models, namely Interface Automata and Weak Interface Automata, define appropriate control problems and describe synthesis algorithms for each of them.Keywords Servers, Maintenance Engineering, Automata, Context, Observability, Uncertainty, Imperfect Information Games, LTS, Controller Synthesis"
Nopol: Automatic Repair of Conditional Statement Bugs in Java Programs,"Abstract We propose Nopol, an approach to automatic repair of buggy conditional statements (i.e., if-then-else statements). This approach takes a buggy program as well as a test suite as input and generates a patch with a conditional expression as output. The test suite is required to contain passing test cases to model the expected behavior of the program and at least one failing test case that reveals the bug to be repaired. The process of Nopol consists of three major phases. First, Nopol employs angelic fix localization to identify expected values of a condition during the test execution. Second, runtime trace collection is used to collect variables and their actual values, including primitive data types and objected-oriented features (e.g., nullness checks), to serve as building blocks for patch generation. Third, Nopol encodes these collected data into an instance of a Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) problem; then a feasible solution to the SMT instance is translated back into a code patch. We evaluate Nopol on 22 real-world bugs (16 bugs with buggy if conditions and six bugs with missing preconditions) on two large open-source projects, namely Apache Commons Math and Apache Commons Lang. Empirical analysis on these bugs shows that our approach can effectively fix bugs with buggy if conditions and missing preconditions. We illustrate the capabilities and limitations of Nopol using case studies of real bug fixes.Keywords Maintenance Engineering, Computer Bugs, Runtime, Java, Encoding, Open Source Software, Indexes, Fault Localization, Automatic Repair, Patch Generation, SMT"
Process Aspects and Social Dynamics of Contemporary Code Review: Insights from Open Source Development and Industrial Practice at Microsoft,"Abstract Many open source and commercial developers practice contemporary code review, a lightweight, informal, tool-based code review process. To better understand this process and its benefits, we gathered information about code review practices via surveys of open source software developers and developers from Microsoft. The results of our analysis suggest that developers spend approximately 10-15 percent of their time in code reviews, with the amount of effort increasing with experience. Developers consider code review important, stating that in addition to finding defects, code reviews offer other benefits, including knowledge sharing, community building, and maintaining code quality. The quality of the code submitted for review helps reviewers form impressions about their teammates, which can influence future collaborations. We found a large amount of similarity between the Microsoft and OSS respondents. One interesting difference is that while OSS respondents view code review as an important method of impression formation, Microsoft respondents found knowledge dissemination to be more important. Finally, we found little difference between distributed and co-located Microsoft teams. Our findings identify the following key areas that warrant focused research: 1) exploring the non-technical benefits of code reviews, 2) helping developers in articulating review comments, and 3) assisting reviewers’ program comprehension during code reviews.Keywords Inspection, Organizations, Collaboration, Context, Instruments, Measurement, Human Factors, Commercial Projects, Code Review, Open Source, OSS, Survey, Peer Impressions"
