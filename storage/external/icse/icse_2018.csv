"""Was my contribution fairly reviewed?"" A framework and an empirical study of fairness in Modern Code Reviews"," Modern code reviews improve the quality of software products. Although modern code reviews rely heavily on human interactions, little is known regarding whether they are performed fairly. Fairness plays a role in any process where decisions that affect others are made. When a system is perceived to be unfair, it affects negatively the productivity and motivation of its participants. In this paper, using fairness theory we create a framework that describes how fairness affects modern code reviews. To demonstrate its applicability, and the importance of fairness in code reviews, we conducted an empirical study that asked developers of a large industrial open source ecosystem (OpenStack) what their perceptions are regarding fairness in their code reviewing process. Our study shows that, in general, the code review process in OpenStack is perceived as fair; however, a significant portion of respondents perceive it as unfair. We also show that the variability in the way they prioritize code reviews signals a lack of consistency and the existence of bias (potentially increasing the perception of unfairness). The contributions of this paper are: we propose a framework—based on fairness theory—for studying and managing social behaviour in modern code reviews, we provide support for the framework through the results of a case study on a large industrial-backed open source project, we present evidence that fairness is an issue in the code review process of a large open source ecosystem, and, we present a set of guidelines for practitioners to address unfairness in modern code reviews.

A Large-Scale Empirical Study on the Effects of Code Obfuscations on Android Apps and Anti-Malware Products," The Android platform has been the dominant mobile platform in recent years resulting in millions of apps and security threats against those apps. Anti-malware products aim to protect smartphone users from these threats, especially from malicious apps. However, malware authors use code obfuscation on their apps to evade detection by anti-malware products. To assess the effects of code obfuscation on Android apps and anti-malware products, we have conducted a large-scale empirical study that evaluates the effectiveness of the top anti-malware products against various obfuscation tools and strategies. To that end, we have obfuscated 3,000 benign apps and 3,000 malicious apps and generated 73,362 obfuscated apps using 29 obfuscation strategies from 7 open-source, academic, and commercial obfuscation tools. The findings of our study indicate that (1) code obfuscation significantly impacts Android anti-malware products; (2) the majority of anti-malware products are severely impacted by even trivial obfuscations; (3) in general, combined obfuscation strategies do not successfully evade anti-malware products more than individual strategies; (4) the detection of anti-malware products depend not only on the applied obfuscation strategy but also on the leveraged obfuscation tool; (5) anti-malware products are slow to adopt signatures of malicious apps; and (6) code obfuscation often results in changes to an app’s semantic behaviors. "
A Static Verification Framework for Message Passing in Go using Behavioural Types," The Go programming language has been heavily adopted in industry as a language that efficiently combines systems programming with concurrency. Go’s concurrency primitives, inspired by process calculi such as CCS and CSP, feature channel-based communication and lightweight threads, providing a distinct means of structuring concurrent software. Despite its popularity, the Go programming ecosystem offers little to no support for guaranteeing the correctness of message-passing concurrent programs. This work proposes a practical verification framework for message passing concurrency in Go by developing a robust static analysis that infers an abstract model of a program’s communication behaviour in the form of a behavioural type, a powerful process calculi typing discipline. We make use of our analysis to deploy a model and termination checking based verification of the inferred behavioural type that is suitable for a range of safety and liveness properties of Go programs, providing several improvements over existing approaches. We evaluate our framework and its implementation on publicly available real-world Go code. "

Accurate and Efficient Refactoring Detection in Commit History," Refactoring detection algorithms have been crucial to a variety of applications: (i) empirical studies about the evolution of code, tests, and faults, (ii) tools for library API migration, (iii) improving the comprehension of changes and code reviews, etc. However, recent research has questioned the accuracy of the state-of-the-art refactoring detection tools, which poses threats to the reliability of their application. Moreover, previous refactoring detection tools are very sensitive to user-provided similarity thresholds, which further reduces their practical accuracy. In addition, their requirement to build the project versions/revisions under analysis makes them inapplicable in many real-world scenarios. To reinvigorate a previously fruitful line of research that has stifled, we designed, implemented, and evaluated RMiner, a technique that overcomes the above limitations. At the heart of RMiner is an AST-based statement matching algorithm that determines refactoring candidates without requiring user-defined thresholds. To empirically evaluate RMiner, we created the most comprehensive oracle to date that uses triangulation to create a dataset with considerably reduced bias, representing 3,188 refactorings from 185 open-source projects. Using this oracle, we found that RMiner has a precision of 98% and recall of 87%, which is a significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art. "
Adding Sparkle to Social Coding: An Empirical Study of Repository Badges in the npm Ecosystem," In fast-paced, reuse-heavy, and distributed software development, the transparency provided by social coding platforms like GitHub is essential to decision making. Developers infer the quality of projects using visible cues, known as signals, collected from personal profile and repository pages. We report on a large-scale, mixed-methods empirical study of npm packages that explores the emerging phenomenon of repository badges, with which maintainers signal underlying qualities about their projects to contributors and users. We investigate which qualities maintainers intend to signal and how well badges correlate with those qualities. After surveying developers, mining 294,941 repositories, and applying statistical modeling and time-series analyses, we find that non-trivial badges, which display the build status, test coverage, and up-to-dateness of dependencies, are mostly reliable signals, correlating with more tests, better pull requests, and fresher dependencies. Displaying such badges correlates with best practices, but the effects do not always persist. "
Almost There: A Study on Quasi-Contributors in Open-Source Software Projects," Recent studies suggest that well-known OSS projects struggle to find the needed workforce to continue evolving—in part because external developers fail to overcome their first contribution barriers. In this paper, we investigate how and why quasi-contributors (external developers who did not succeed in getting their contributions accepted to an OSS project) fail. To achieve our goal, we collected data from 21 popular, non-trivial GitHub projects, identified quasi-contributors, and analyzed their pull-requests. In addition, we conducted surveys with quasi-contributors, and projects’ integrators, to understand their perceptions about nonacceptance. We found 10,099 quasi-contributors — about 70% of the total actual contributors — that submitted 12,367 nonaccepted pull-requests. In five projects, we found more quasi-contributors than actual contributors. About one-third of the developers who took our survey disagreed with the nonacceptance, and around 30% declared the nonacceptance demotivated or prevented them from placing another pull-request. The main reasons for pull-request nonacceptance from the quasi-contributors’ perspective were “superseded/duplicated pull-request” and “mismatch between developer’s and team’s vision/opinion.” A manual analysis of a representative sample of 263 pull-requests corroborated with this finding. We also found reasons related to the relationship with the community and lack of experience or commitment from the quasi-contributors. This empirical study is particularly relevant to those interested in fostering developers’ participation and retention in OSS communities. "
Are Code Examples on an Online Q&A Forum Reliable? A Study of API Misuse on Stack Overflow," Programmers often consult an online Q&A forum such as Stack Over ow to learn new APIs. This paper presents an empirical study on the prevalence and severity of API misuse on Stack Over ow. To reduce manual assessment e ort, we design ExampleCheck, an API usage mining framework that extracts patterns from over 380K Java repositories on GitHub and subsequently reports potential API usage violations in Stack Over ow posts. We analyze 217,818 Stack Over ow posts using ExampleCheck and nd that 31% may have potential API usage violations that could produce unexpected behavior such as program crashes and resource leaks. Such API misuse is caused by three main reasons—missing control constructs, missing or incorrect order of API calls, and incorrect guard conditions. Even the posts that are accepted as correct answers or upvoted by other programmers are not necessarily more reliable than other posts in terms of API misuse. This study result calls for a new approach to augment Stack Over ow with alternative API usage details that are not typically shown in curated examples. "
Are Mutation Scores Correlated with Real Fault Detection? A Large Scale Empirical study on the Relationship Between Mutants and Real Faults," Empirical validation of software testing studies is increasingly relying on mutants. This practice is motivated by the strong correlation between mutant scores and real fault detection that is reported in the literature. In contrast, our study shows that correlations are the results of the confounding effects of the test suite size. In particular, we investigate the relation between two independent variables, mutation score and test suite size, with one dependent variable the detection of (real) faults. We use two data sets, CoreBench and Defects4J, with large C and Java programs and real faults and provide evidence that all correlations between mutation scores and real fault detection are weak when controlling for test suite size. We also find that both independent variables significantly influence the dependent one, with significantly better fits, but overall with relative low prediction power. By measuring the fault detection capability of the top ranked, according to mutation score, test suites (opposed to randomly selected test suites of the same size), we find that achieving higher mutation scores improves significantly the fault detection. Taken together, our data suggest that mutants provide good guidance for improving the fault detection of test suites, but their correlation with fault detection are weak. "
Assessing the Threat of Untracked Changes in Software Evolution,
Augusto: Exploiting Popular Functionalities for the Generation of Semantic GUI Tests with Oracles," Testing software applications by interacting with their graphical user interface (GUI) is an expensive and complex process. Current automatic test case generation techniques implement explorative approaches that, although producing useful test cases, have a limited capability of covering semantically relevant interactions, thus frequently missing important testing scenarios. These techniques typically interact with the available widgets following the structure of the GUI, without any guess about the functions that are executed. In this paper we propose Augusto, a test case generation technique that exploits a built-in knowledge of the semantics associated with popular and well-known functionalities, such as CRUD operations, to automatically generate effective test cases with automated functional oracles. Empirical results indicate that Augusto can reveal faults that cannot be revealed with state of the art techniques. "

Automatically Generating Search Heuristics for Concolic Testing," We present a technique to automatically generate search heuristics for concolic testing. A key challenge in concolic testing is how to effectively explore the program’s execution paths to achieve high code coverage in a limited time budget. Concolic testing employs a search heuristic to address this challenge, which favors exploring particular types of paths that are most likely to maximize the final coverage. However, manually designing a good search heuristic is nontrivial and typically ends up with suboptimal and unstable outcomes. The goal of this paper is to overcome this shortcoming of concolic testing by automatically generating search heuristics. We define a class of search heuristics, namely a parameterized heuristic, and present an algorithm that efficiently finds an optimal heuristic for each subject program. Experimental results with open-source C programs show that our technique successfully generates search heuristics that significantly outperform existing manually-crafted heuristics in terms of branch coverage and bug-finding.

Chopped Symbolic Execution," Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis technique that systematically explores multiple program paths. However, despite important technical advances, symbolic execution often struggles to reach deep parts of the code due to the well-known path explosion problem and constraint solving limitations. In this paper, we propose chopped symbolic execution, a novel form of symbolic execution that allows users to specify uninteresting parts of the code to exclude during the analysis, thus only targeting the exploration to paths of importance. However, the excluded parts are not summarily ignored, as this may lead to both false positives and false negatives. Instead, they are executed lazily, when their effect may be observable by code under analysis. Chopped symbolic execution leverages various on-demand static analyses at runtime to automatically exclude code fragments while resolving their side effects, thus avoiding expensive manual annotations and imprecision. Our preliminary results show that the approach can effectively improve the effectiveness of symbolic execution in several different scenarios, including failure reproduction and test suite augmentation.

Collective Program Analysis," Popularity of data-driven software engineering has led to an increasing demand on the infrastructures to support efficient execution of tasks that require deeper source code analysis. While task optimization and parallelization are the adopted solutions, other research directions are less explored. We present collective program analysis (CPA), a technique for scaling large scale source code analysis by leveraging analysis specific similarity. Analysis specific similarity is about, whether two or more programs can be considered similar for a given analysis. The key idea of collective program analysis is to cluster programs based on analysis specific similarity, such that running the analysis on one candidate in each cluster is sufficient to produce the result for others. For determining the analysis specific similarity and for clustering analysis-equivalent programs, we use a sparse representation and a canonical labeling scheme. A sparse representation contains only the parts that are relevant for the analysis and the canonical labeling helps with finding isomorphic sparse representations. In a nutshell, two or more programs with same sparse representation must behave similarly for the given analysis. Our evaluation shows that for a variety of source code analysis tasks when run on a large dataset of programs, our technique is able to achieve substantial reduction in the analysis times; on average 69% when compared to baseline and on average 36% when compared to a prior technique. We also show that there exists a large amount of analysis-equivalent programs in large datasets for variety of analysis. "
ConflictJS: Finding and Understanding Conflicts Between JavaScript Libraries," It is a common practice for client-side web applications to build on various third-party JavaScript libraries. Due to the lack of namespaces in JavaScript, these libraries all share the same global namespace. As a result, one library may inadvertently modify or even delete the APIs of another library, causing unexpected behavior of library clients. Given the quickly increasing number of libraries, manually keeping track of such conflicts is practically impossible both for library developers and users. This paper presents ConflictJS, an automated and scalable approach to analyze libraries for conflicts. The key idea is to tackle the huge search space of possible conflicts in two phases. At first, a dynamic analysis of individual libraries identifies pairs of potentially conflicting libraries. Then, targeted test synthesis validates potential conflicts by creating a client application that suffers from a conflict. The overall approach is free of false positives, in the sense that it reports a problem only when such a client exists. We use ConflictJS to analyze and study conflicts among 951 real-world libraries. The results show that one out of four libraries is potentially conflicting and that 166 libraries are involved in at least one certain conflict. The detected conflicts cause crashes and other kinds of unexpected behavior. Our work helps library developers to prevent conflicts, library users to avoid combining conflicting libraries, and provides evidence that designing a language without explicit namespaces has undesirable effects. "
Context-Aware Conversational Developer Assistants," Building and maintaining modern software systems requires developers to perform a variety of tasks that span various tools and information sources. The crosscutting nature of these development tasks requires developers to maintain complex mental models and forces them (a) to manually split their high-level tasks into low-level commands that are supported by the various tools, and (b) to (re)establish their current context in each tool. In this paper we present Devy, a Conversational Developer Assistant (CDA) that enables developers to focus on their high-level development tasks. Devy reduces the number of manual, often complex, low-level commands that developers need to perform, freeing them to focus on their high-level tasks. Specifically, Devy infers high-level intent from developer’s voice commands and combines this with an automatically-generated context model to determine appropriate workflows for invoking lowlevel tool actions; where needed, Devy can also prompt the developer for additional information. Through a mixed methods evaluation with 21 industrial developers, we found that Devy provided an intuitive interface that was able to support many development tasks while helping developers stay focused within their development environment. While industrial developers were largely supportive of the automation Devy enabled, they also provided insights into several other tasks and workflows CDAs could support to enable them to better focus on the important parts of their development tasks. "
Context-Aware Patch Generation for Better Automated Program Repair," Because of its potential impacts, search-based automated program repair has received great attention in the research community. However, its effectiveness is limited in the number of correct patches that can be successfully generated. There are two causes of such limitation. First, the search space does not contain the correct patch. Second, the search space is huge and therefore the correct patch cannot be generated (\ie correct patches are either generated after incorrect plausible ones or not generated within the time budget). To increase the likelihood of including correct patches in the search space, we propose to work at a fine granularity in terms of AST nodes. This, however, will further enlarge the search space, increasing the challenge to find the correct patches. We address the challenge by devising a strategy to prioritize the candidate patches based on their likelihood of being correct. Specifically, we study the use of AST nodes’ context information to estimate the likelihood. In this paper, we propose \textsc{CapGen}, a context-aware patch generation technique. The novelty which allows \textsc{CapGen} to produce more correct patches lies in three aspects: (1) The fine-granularity design enables it to find more correct fixing ingredients; (2) The context-aware prioritization of mutation operators enables it to constrain the search space; (3) Three context-aware models enable it to rank correct patches at high positions before incorrect plausible ones. We evaluate \textsc{CapGen} on \textsc{Defects4J} and compare it with the state-of-the-art program repair techniques. Our evaluation shows that \textsc{CapGen} outperforms and complements existing techniques. \textsc{CapGen} achieves a high precision of $84.00%$ and can prioritize the correct patches before $98.78%$ of the incorrect plausible ones.

Dataflow Tunneling: Mining Inter-request Data Dependencies for Request-based Applications," Request-based applications, e.g., most server-side applications, expose services to users in a request-based paradigm, in which requests are served by request-handler methods. An important task for request-based applications is inter-request analysis, which analyzes request-handler methods that are related by inter-request data dependencies together. However, in the request-based paradigm, data dependencies between related request-handler methods are implicitly established by the underlying frameworks that execute these methods. As a result, existing analysis tools are usually limited to the scope of each single method without the knowledge of dependencies between different methods. In this paper, we design an approach called dataflow tunneling to capture inter-request data dependencies from concrete application executions and produce data-dependency specifications. Our approach answers two key questions: (1) what request-handler methods have data dependencies and (2) what these data dependencies are. Our evaluation using applications developed with two representative and popular frameworks shows that our approach is general and accurate. We also present a characteristic study and a use case of cache tuning based on the mined specifications. We envision that our approach can provide key information to enable future inter-request analysis techniques. "
DeFlaker: Automatically Detecting Flaky Tests," Developers often run tests to check that their latest changes to a code repository did not break any previously working functionality. Ideally, any new test failures would indicate regressions caused by the latest changes. However, some test failures may not be due to the latest changes but due to non-determinism in the tests, popularly called flaky tests. The typical way to detect flaky tests is to rerun failing tests repeatedly. Unfortunately, rerunning failing tests can be costly and can slow down the development cycle. We present the first extensive evaluation of rerunning failing tests and propose a new technique, called DeFlaker, that detects if a test failure is due to a flaky test without rerunning and with very low runtime overhead. DeFlaker monitors the coverage of latest code changes and marks as flaky any newly failing test that did not execute any of the changes. We deployed DeFlaker live, in the build process of 96 Java projects on TravisCI, and found 87 previously unknown flaky tests in 10 of these projects. We also ran experiments on project histories, where DeFlaker detected 1,874 flaky tests from 4,846 failures, with a low false alarm rate (1.5%). DeFlaker had a higher recall (95.5% vs. 23%) of confirmed flaky tests than Maven’s default flaky test detector. "

Deuce: A Lightweight User Interface for Structured Editing," We present a structure-aware code editor, called Deuce, that is equipped with direct manipulation capabilities for invoking automated program transformations. Compared to traditional refactoring environments, Deuce employs a direct manipulation interface that is tightly integrated within a text-based editing workflow. In particular, Deuce draws (i) clickable widgets atop the source code that allow the user to structurally select the unstructured text for subexpressions and other relevant features, and (ii) a lightweight, interactive menu of potential transformations based on the current selections. We implement and evaluate our design with mostly standard transformations in the context of a small functional programming language. A controlled user study with 21 participants demonstrates that structural selection is preferred to a more traditional text-selection interface and may be faster overall once users gain experience with the tool. These results accord with Deuce’s aim to provide human-friendly structural interactions on top of familiar text-based editing. "
Do You Remember This Source Code?,
Do programmers work at night or during weekend?," Abnormal working hours can reduce work health, general well-being, and productivity, independent from a profession. To inform future approaches for automatic stress and overload detection, this paper establishes empirically collected measures of the work patterns of software engineers. To this aim, we perform the first large-scale study of software engineers’ working hours by investigating the time stamps of commit activities of 86 large open source software projects, both containing hired and volunteer developers. We find that two thirds of software engineers mainly follow typical office hours, empirically established to be from 10h to 18h, and do not usually work during nights and weekends. Large variations between projects and individuals exist. Surprisingly, we found no support that project maturation would decrease abnormal working hours. In the Firefox case study, we found that hired developers work more during office hours while seniority, either in terms of number of commits or job status, did not impact working hours. We conclude that the use of working hours or timestamps of work products for stress detection requires establishing baselines at the level of individuals. "
Does the Propagation of Artifact Changes across Tasks reflect Work Dependencies?," Developers commonly define tasks to help coordinate software development efforts-whether they be feature implementation, refactoring, or bug fixes. Developers establish links between tasks to express implicit dependencies that needs explicit handling-dependencies that often require the developers responsible for a given task to assess how changes in a linked task affect their own work and vice versa (i.e., change propagation). While seemingly useful, it is unknown if change propagation indeed coincides with task links. No study has investigated to what extent change propagation actually occurs between task pairs and whether it is able to serve as a metric for characterizing the underlying task dependency. In this paper, we study the temporal relationship between developer reading and changing of source code in relationship to task links. We identify seven situations that explain the varying correlation of change propagation with linked task pairs and find six motifs describing when change propagation occurs between non-linked task pairs. Our paper demonstrates that task links are indeed useful for recommending which artifacts to monitor for changes, which developers to involve in a task, or which tasks to inspect. "
DroidStar: Callback Typestates for Android Classes,
Efficient Sampling of SAT Solutions for Testing," In software and hardware testing, generating multiple inputs which satisfy a given set of constraints is an important problem with applications in fuzz testing and stimulus generation. However, it is a challenge to perform the sampling efficiently, while generating a diverse set of inputs which satisfy the constraints. We developed a new algorithm QuickSampler which requires a small number of solver calls to produce millions of samples which satisfy the constraints with high probability. We evaluate QuickSampler on large real-world benchmarks and show that it can produce unique valid solutions orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art sampling tools, with a distribution which is reasonably close to uniform in practice.

EnMobile: Entity-based Characterization and Analysis of Mobile Malware," Modern mobile malware tend to conduct their malicious exploits through sophisticated patterns of interactions that involve multiple entities, e.g., the mobile platform, human users, and network locations. Such malware often evade the detection by existing approaches due to their limited expressiveness and accuracy in characterizing and detecting these malware. To address these issues, in this paper, we recognize entities in the environment of an app, the app’s interactions with such entities, and the provenance of these interactions, i.e., the intent and ownership of each interaction, as the key to comprehensively characterizing modern mobile apps, and mobile malware in particular. With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app’s interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware. We evaluate EnMobile on a set of 6614 apps consisting of malware from Genome and Drebin along with benign apps from Google Play. Our results show that EnMobile detects malware with substantially higher precision and recall than four state-of-the-art approaches, namely Apposcopy, Drebin, MUDFLOW, and AppContext. "
Enlightened Debugging," Numerous automated techniques have been proposed to reduce the cost of software debugging, a notoriously time-consuming and human-intensive activity. Among these techniques, Statistical Fault Localization (SFL) is particularly popular. One issue with SFL is that it is based on strong, often unrealistic assumptions on how developers behave when debugging. To address this problem, we propose Enlighten, an interactive, feedback-driven fault localization technique. Given a failing test, Enlighten (1) leverages SFL and dynamic dependence analysis to identify suspicious method invocations and corresponding data values, (2) presents the developer with a query about the most suspicious invocation expressed in terms of inputs and outputs, (3) encodes the developer feedback on the correctness of individual data values as extra program speci cations, and (4) repeats these steps until the fault is found. We evaluated Enlighten in two ways. First, we applied Enlighten to 1,807 real and seeded faults in 3 open source programs using an automated oracle as a simulated user; for over 96% of these faults, Enlighten required less than 10 interactions with the simulated user to localize the fault, and a sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to erroneous responses. Second, we performed an actual user study on 4 faults with 24 participants and found that participants who used Enlighten performed signi cantly better than those not using our tool, in terms of both number of faults localized and time needed to localize the faults. "
FAST Approaches to Scalable Similarity-based Test Case Prioritization," Many test case prioritization criteria have been proposed for speeding up fault detection. Among them, similarity-based approaches give priority to the test cases that are the most dissimilar from those already selected. However, the proposed criteria do not scale up to handle the many thousands or even some millions test suite sizes of modern industrial systems and simple heuristics are used instead. We introduce the FAST family of test case prioritization techniques that radically changes this landscape by borrowing algorithms commonly exploited in the big data domain to find similar items. FAST techniques provide scalable similarity-based test case prioritization in both white-box and black-box fashion. The results from experimentation on real world C and Java subjects show that the fastest members of the family outperform other black-box approaches in efficiency with no significant impact on effectiveness, and also outperform white-box approaches, including greedy ones, if preparation time is not counted. A simulation study of scalability shows that one FAST technique can prioritize a million test cases in less than 20 minutes. "
FaCoY – A Code-to-Code Search Engine," Code search is an unavoidable activity in software development. Various approaches and techniques have been explored in the literature to support code search tasks. Most of these approaches focus on serving user queries provided as natural language free-form input. However, there exists a wide range of use-case scenarios where a code-to-code approach would be most beneficial. For example, research directions in code transplantation, code diversity, patch recommendation can leverage a code-to-code search engine to find essential ingredients for their techniques. In this paper, we propose FaCoY, a novel approach for statically finding code fragments which may be semantically similar to user input code. FaCoY implements a query alternation strategy: instead of directly matching code query tokens with code in the search space, FaCoY first attempts to identify other tokens which may also be relevant in implementing the functional behavior of the input code. With various experiments, we show that (1) FaCoY is more effective than online code-to-code search engines; (2) FaCoY can detect more semantic code clones (i.e., Type-4) in BigCloneBench than the state-of-the-art; (3) FaCoY, while static, can detect code fragments which are indeed similar with respect to runtime execution behavior; and (4) FaCoY can be useful in code/patch recommendation.

Fine-Grained Test Minimization," As a software system evolves, its test suite can accumulate redundancies over time. Test minimization aims at removing redundant test cases. However, current techniques remove whole test cases from the test suite using test adequacy criteria, such as code coverage. This has two limitations, namely (1) by removing a whole test case the corresponding test assertions are also lost, which can inhibit test suite effectiveness, (2) the issue of partly redundant test cases, i.e., tests with redundant test statements, is ignored. We propose a novel approach for fine-grained test case minimization. Our analysis is based on the inference of a test suite model that enables automated test reorganization within test cases. It enables removing redundancies at the test statement level, while preserving the coverage and test assertions of the test suite. We evaluated our approach, implemented in a tool called Testler, on the test suites of 15 open source projects. Our analysis shows that over 4,639 (24%) of the tests in these test suites are partly redundant, with over 11,819 redundant test statements in total. Our results show that Testler removes 43% of the redundant test statements, reducing the number of partly redundant tests by 52%. As a result, test suite execution time is reduced by up to 37% (20% on average), while maintaining the original statement coverage, branch coverage, test assertions, and fault detection capability. "
From UI Design Image to GUI Skeleton: A Neural Machine Translator to Bootstrap Mobile GUI Implementation," A GUI skeleton is the starting point for implementing a UI design image. To obtain a GUI skeleton from a UI design image, developers have to visually understand UI elements and their spatial layout in the image, and then translate this understanding into proper GUI components and their compositions. Automating this visual understanding and translation would be beneficial for bootstraping mobile GUI implementation, but it is a challenging task due to the diversity of UI designs and the complexity of GUI skeletons to generate. Existing tools are rigid as they depend on heuristically-designed visual understanding and GUI generation rules. In this paper, we present a neural machine translator that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation for translating a UI design image into a GUI skeleton. Our translator learns to extract visual features in UI images, encode these features’ spatial layouts, and generate GUI skeletons in a unified neural network framework, without requiring manual rule development. For training our translator, we develop an automated GUI exploration method to automatically collect large-scale UI data from real-world applications. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, generality and usefulness of our approach. "
GUILeak: Tracing Privacy-Policy Claims on User Input Data for Android Applications,
Generalized Data Structure Synthesis," Data structure synthesis is the task of generating data structure implementations from high-level specifications. Recent work in this area has shown potential to save programmer time and reduce the risk of defects. Existing techniques focus on data structures for manipulating subsets of a single collection, but real-world programs often track multiple related collections and aggregate properties such as sums, counts, minimums, and maximums. This paper shows how to synthesize data structures that track subsets and aggregations of multiple related collections. Our technique decomposes the synthesis task into alternating steps of query synthesis and incrementalization. The query synthesis step implements pure operations over the data structure state by leveraging existing enumerative synthesis techniques, specialized to the data structures domain. The incrementalization step implements imperative state modifications by re-framing them as fresh queries that determine what to change, coupled with a small amount of code to apply the change. As an added benefit of this approach over previous work, the synthesized data structure is optimized for not only the queries in the specification but also the required update operations. We have evaluated our approach in four large case studies, demonstrating that these extensions are broadly applicable. "
Goal-Conflict Likelihood Assessment based on Model Counting," In goal-oriented requirements engineering approaches, conflict analysis has been proposed as an abstraction for risk analysis. Intu- itively, given a set of expected goals to be achieved by the system-to-be, a conflict represents a subtle situation that makes goals diverge, i.e., not be satis able as a whole. Conflict analysis is typically driven by the identify-assess-control cycle, aimed at identifying, assessing and resolving conflicts that may obstruct the satisfaction of the expected goals. In particular, the assessment step is concerned with evaluating how likely the identi ed conflicts are, and how likely and severe are their consequences. So far, existing assessment approaches restrict their analysis to obstacles (conflicts that prevent the satisfaction of a single goal), and assume that certain probabilistic information on the domain is pro- vided, that needs to be previously elicited from experienced users, statistical data or simulations. In this paper, we present a novel automated approach to assess how likely a conflict is, that applies to general conflicts (not only obstacles) without requiring probabilistic information on the domain. Intuitively, given the LTL formulation of the domain and of a set of goals to be achieved, we compute goal conflicts, and exploit string model counting techniques to estimate the likelihood of the occurrence of the corresponding conflicting situations and the severity in which these a ect the satisfaction of the goals. This information can then be used to prioritize conflicts to be resolved, and suggest which goals to drive attention to for refinements. "
HireBuild: An Automatic Approach to History-Driven Repair of Build Scripts,
How Modern News Aggregators Help Development Communities Shape and Share Knowledge," Many developers rely on modern news aggregator sites such as Reddit and Hacker News to stay up to date with the latest technological developments and trends. In order to understand what motivates developers to contribute, what kind of content is shared, and how knowledge is shaped by the community, we interviewed and surveyed developers that participate on the Reddit programming subreddit and we analyzed a sample of posts on both Reddit and Hacker News. We learned what kind of content is shared in these websites and developer motivations for posting, sharing, discussing, evaluating, and aggregating knowledge on these aggregators, while revealing challenges developers face in terms of how content and participant behavior is moderated. Our insights aim to improve the practices developers follow when using news aggregators, as well as guide tool makers on how to improve their tools. Our findings are also relevant to researchers that study developer communities of practice. "
How not to structure your database-backed web applications: a study of performance bugs in the wild," Many web applications use databases for persistent data storage, and using Object Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks is a common way to develop such database-backed web applications. Unfortunately, developing efficient ORM applications is challenging, as the ORM framework hides the underlying database query generation and execution. This problem is becoming more severe as these applications need to process an increasingly large amount of persistent data. Recent research has targeted specific aspects of performance problems in ORM applications. However, there has not been any systematic study to identify common performance antipatterns in real-world such applications, how they affect resulting application performance, and remedies for them. In this paper, we try to answer these questions through a comprehensive study of 12 representative real-world ORM applications. We generalize 9 ORM performance anti-patterns from more than 200 performance issues that we obtain by studying their bug-tracking systems and profiling their latest versions. To prove our point, we manually fix 64 performance issues in their latest versions and obtain a median speedup of 2× (and up to 39× max) with fewer than 5 lines of code change in most cases. Many of the issues we found have been confirmed by developers, and we have implemented ways to identify other code fragments with similar issues as well. "
Hybrid Regression Test Selection,
Identifying Design Problems in the Source Code: A Grounded Theory," The prevalence of design problems may cause re-engineering or even discontinuation of the system. Due to missing, informal or outdated design documentation, developers often have to rely on the source code to identify design problems. Therefore, developers have to analyze different symptoms that manifest in several code elements, which may quickly turn into a complex task. Although researchers have been investigating techniques to help developers in identifying design problems, there is little knowledge on how developers actually proceed to identify design problems. In order to tackle this problem, we conducted a multi-trial industrial experiment with professionals from 5 software companies to build a grounded theory. The resulting theory offers explanations on how developers identify design problems in practice. For instance, it reveals the characteristics of symptoms that developers consider helpful. Moreover, developers often combine different types of symptoms to identify a single design problem. This knowledge serves as a basis to further understand the phenomena and advance towards more effective identification techniques. "
Identifying Features in Forks,
Identifying Patch Correctness in Test-Based Program Repair," Test-based automatic program repair has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, the test suites in practice are often too weak to guarantee correctness and existing approaches often generate a large number of incorrect patches. To reduce the number of incorrect patches generated, we propose a novel approach that heuristically determines the correctness of the generated patches. The core idea is to exploit the behavior similarity of test case executions. The passing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave similarly while the failing tests on original and patched programs are likely to behave differently. Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime behavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results. Based on these observations, we generate new test inputs to enhance the test suites and use their behavior similarity to determine patch correctness. Our approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 139 patches generated from existing program repair systems including jGenProg, Nopol, jKali, ACS and HDRepair. Our approach successfully prevented 56.3% of the incorrect patches to be generated, without blocking any correct patches. "
Inferring Hierarchical Motifs from Execution Traces,
Inferring and Asserting Distributed System Invariants," Distributed systems are difficult to debug and understand. A key reason for this is distributed state, which is not easily accessible and must be pieced together from the states of the individual nodes in the system. We propose Dinv, an automatic approach to help developers of distributed systems uncover the runtime distributed state properties of their systems. Dinv uses static and dynamic program analyses to infer relations between variables at different nodes. For example, in a leader election algorithm, Dinv can relate the variable leader at different nodes to derive the invariant ∀ nodes i, j, leader_i = leader_j. This can increase the developer’s confidence in the correctness of their system. The developer can also use Dinv to convert an inferred invariant into a distributed runtime assertion on distributed state. We applied Dinv to several popular distributed systems, such as etcd Raft, Hashicorp Serf, and Taipei-Torrent, which have between 1.7K and 144K LOC and are widely used. Dinv derived useful invariants for these systems, including invariants that capture the correctness of distributed routing strategies, leadership, and key hash distribution. We also used Dinv to assert correctness of the inferred etcd Raft invariants at runtime, using these asserts to detect injected silent bugs.

Inheritance Usage Patterns in Open-Source Systems," This research investigates how object-oriented inheritance is actually used in practice. The aim is to close the gap between inheritance guidance and inheritance practice. It is based on detailed analyses of 2440 inheritance hierarchies drawn from 14 open-source systems. The original contributions made by this paper concern pragmatic assessment of inheritance hierarchy design quality. The findings show that inheritance is very widely used but that most of the usage patterns that occur in practice are simple in structure. They are so simple that they may not require much inheritance-specific design consideration. On the other hand, the majority of classes defined using inheritance actually appear within a relatively small number of large, complex hierarchies. While some of these large hierarchies appear to have a consistent structure, often based on a problem domain model or a design pattern, others do not. Another contribution is that the quality of hierarchies, especially the large problematic ones, may be assessed in practice based on size, shape, and the definition and invocation of novel methods – all properties that can be detected automatically.

"Is ""Better Data"" Better Than ""Better Data Miners""?"," We report and fix an important systematic error in prior studies that ranked classifiers for software analytics. Those studies did not (a) assess classifiers on multiple criteria and they did not (b) study how variations in the data affect the results. Hence, this paper applies (a) multi-criteria tests while (b) fixing the weaker regions of the training data (using SMOTUNED, which is a self-tuning version of SMOTE). This approach leads to dramatically large increases in software defect predictions. When applied in a 5*5 cross-validation study for 3,681 JAVA classes (containing over a million lines of code) from open source systems, SMOTUNED increased AUC and recall by 60% and 20% respectively. These improvements are independent of the classifier used to predict for quality. Same kind of pattern (improvement) was observed when a comparative analysis of SMOTE and SMOTUNED was done against the most recent class imbalance technique. In conclusion, for software analytic tasks like defect prediction, (1) data pre-processing can be more important than classifier choice, (2) ranking studies are incomplete without such pre-processing, and (3) SMOTUNED is a promising candidate for pre-processing.

Leveraging Program Analysis to Reduce User-Perceived Latency in Mobile Applications," Reducing network latency in mobile applications is an effective way of improving the mobile user experience and has tangible economic benefits. This paper presents PALOMA, a novel client-centric technique for reducing the network latency by prefetching HTTP requests in Android apps. Our work leverages string analysis and callback control-flow analysis to automatically instrument apps using PALOMA’s rigorous formulation of scenarios that address “what” and “when” to prefetch. PALOMA has been shown to incur significant runtime savings (several hundred milliseconds per prefetchable HTTP request), both when applied on a reusable evaluation benchmark we have developed and on real applications.

Multi-Granular Conflict and Dependency Analysis in Software Engineering based on Graph Transformation," Conflict and dependency analysis (CDA) of graph transformation has been shown to be a versatile foundation for understanding interactions in many software engineering domains, including software analysis and design, model-driven engineering, and testing. In this paper, we propose a novel static CDA technique that is multi-granular in the sense that it can detect all conflicts and dependencies on multiple granularity levels. Specifically, we provide an efficient algorithm suite for computing binary, coarse-grained, and fine-grained conflicts and dependencies: Binary granularity indicates the presence or absence of conflicts and dependencies, coarse granularity focuses on root causes for conflicts and dependencies, and fine granularity shows each conflict and dependency in full detail. Doing so, we can address specific performance and usability requirements that we identified in a literature survey of CDA usage scenarios. In an experimental evaluation, our algorithm suite computes conflicts and dependencies rapidly. Finally, we present a user study, in which the participants found our coarse-grained results more understandable than the fine-grained ones reported in a state-of-the-art tool. Our overall contribution is twofold: (i) we significantly speed up the computation of fine-grained and binary CDA results and, (ii) complement them with coarse-grained ones, which offer usability benefits for numerous use cases. "
Multi-Objective Integer Programming Approaches for Solving Optimal Feature Selection Problem," The optimal feature selection problem in software product line is typically addressed by the approaches based on Indicator-based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA). In this study, we first expose the mathematical nature of this problem — multi-objective binary integer linear programming. Then, we implement/propose three mathematical programming approaches to solve this problem at diﬀerent scales. For small-scale problems (roughly, less than 100 features), we implement two established approaches to find all exact solutions. For medium-to-large problems (roughly, more than 100 features), we propose one efficient approach that can generate a representation of the entire Pareto front in linear time complexity. The empirical results show that our proposed method can find significantly more non-dominated solutions in similar or less execution time, in comparison with IBEA and its recent enhancement (i.e., IBED that combines IBEA and Diﬀerential Evolution). "
Nemo: Multi-Criteria Test-Suite Minimization with Integer Nonlinear Programming," Multi-criteria test-suite minimization aims to remove redundant test cases from a test suite based on some criteria such as code coverage, while trying to optimally maintain the capability of the reduced suite based on other criteria such as fault-detection effectiveness. Existing techniques addressing this problem with integer linear programming claim to produce optimal solutions. However, the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem is inherently nonlinear, due to the fact that test cases are often dependent on each other in terms of test-case criteria. In this paper, we propose a framework that formulates the multi-criteria test-suite minimization problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve this problem optimally, we programmatically transform this nonlinear problem into a linear one and then solve the problem using modern linear solvers. We have implemented our framework as a tool, called Nemo, that supports a number of modern linear and nonlinear solvers. We have evaluated Nemo with a publicly available dataset and minimization problems involving multiple criteria including statement coverage, fault-revealing capability, and test execution time. The experimental results show that Nemo can be used to efficiently find an optimal solution for multi-criteria test-suite minimization problems with modern solvers, and the optimal solutions outperform the suboptimal ones by up to 164.29% in terms of the criteria considered in the problem.

Neuro-Symbolic Program Repair for Correcting Introductory Programming Assignments,
On The Dichotomy of Debugging Behavior Among Programmers," Debugging is an inevitable activity in most software projects, often difficult and more time-consuming than expected, giving it the nick- name the “dirty little secret of computer science.” Surprisingly, we have little knowledge on how software engineers debug software problems in the real world, whether they use dedicated debugging tools, and how knowledgeable they are about debugging. This study aims to shed light on these aspects by following a mixed-methods research approach. We conduct an online survey capturing how 176 developers reflect on debugging. We augment this subjective survey data with objective observations on how 458 developers use the debugger included in their integrated development environments (IDEs) by instrumenting the popular ECLIPSE and INTELLIJ IDEs with the purpose-built plugin WATCHDOG 2.0. To clarify the in- sights and discrepancies observed in the previous steps, we followed up by conducting interviews with debugging experts and regular de- bugging users. Our results indicate that IDE-provided debuggers are not used as often as expected, as “printf debugging” remains a fea- sible choice for many programmers. Furthermore, both knowledge and use of advanced debugging features are low. These results call to strengthen hands-on debugging experience in computer science curricula and have already refined the implementation of modern IDE debuggers. "
Online App Review Analysis for Identifying Emerging Issues," Detecting emerging issues (e.g., new bugs) timely and precisely is crucial for developers to update their apps. App reviews provide an opportunity to proactively collect user complaints and promptly improve apps’ user experience, in terms of bug fixing and feature refinement. However, the tremendous quantities of reviews and noise words (e.g., misspelled words) increase the difficulties in accurately identifying newly-appearing app issues. In this paper, we propose a novel and automated framework IDEA, which aims to IDentify Emerging App issues effectively based on online review analysis. We evaluate IDEA on six popular apps from Google Play and Apple’s App Store, employing the official app changelogs as our ground truth. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of IDEA in identifying emerging app issues. Feedback from engineers and product managers shows that 88.9% of them think that the identified issues can facilitate app development in practice. Moreover, we have successfully applied IDEA to several products of Tencent, which serve hundreds of millions of users. "
"Open Source barriers to entry, revisited: A tools perspective"," Research has revealed that significant barriers exist when entering Open-Source Software (OSS) communities and that women disproportionately experience such barriers. However, this research has focused mainly on social/cultural factors, ignoring the environment itself — the tools and infrastructure. To shed some light onto how tools and infrastructure might somehow factor into OSS barriers to entry, we conducted a field study with five teams of software professionals, who worked through five use-cases to analyze the tools and infrastructure used in their OSS projects. These software professionals found tool/infrastructure barriers in 7% to 71% of the use-case steps that they analyzed, most of which are tied to newcomer barriers that have been established in the literature. Further, over 80% of the barrier types they found include attributes that are biased against women. "

Program Splicing,
Programming Not Only by Example," Recent years have seen great progress in automated synthesis techniques that can automatically generate code based on some intent expressed by the programmer, but communicating this intent remains a major challenge. When the expressed intent is coarse-grained (for example, restriction on the expected type of an expression), the synthesizer often produces a long list of results for the programmer to choose from, shifting the heavy-lifting to the user. An alternative approach, successfully used in end-user synthesis, is programming by example (PBE), where the user leverages examples to interactively and iteratively refine the intent. However, using only examples is not expressive enough for programmers, who can observe the generated program and refine the intent by directly relating to parts of the generated program. We present a novel approach to interacting with a synthesizer using a granular interaction model. Our approach employs a rich interaction model where (i) the synthesizer decorates a candidate program with debug information that assists in understanding the program and identifying good or bad parts, and (ii) the user is allowed to provide feedback not only on the expected output of a program but also on the program itself. After identifying a program as (partially) correct or incorrect, the user can also explicitly indicate the good or bad parts, to allow the synthesizer to accept or discard parts of the program instead of discarding the program as a whole. We show the value of our approach in a controlled user study. Our study shows that participants have a strong preference for granular feedback instead of examples and can provide granular feedback much faster. "
Propagating Configuration Decisions with Modal Implication Graphs,
RFC-Directed Differential Testing of Certificate Validation in SSL/TLS Implementations," Certificate validation in Secure Socket Layer or Transport Layer Security protocol (SSL/TLS) is critical to Internet security. Thus, it is significant to check whether certificate validation in SSL/TLS is correctly implemented. With this motivation, we propose a novel differential testing approach which is directed by the standard Request For Comments (RFC). First, rules of certificates are extracted automatically from RFCs. Second, low-level test cases are generated through dynamic symbolic execution. Third, high-level test cases, i.e. certificates, are assembled automatically. Finally, with the assembled certificates being test cases, certificate validations in SSL/TLS implementations are tested to reveal latent vulnerabilities or bugs. Our approach named RFCcert has the following advantages: (1) certificates of RFCcert are discrepancy-targeted since they are assembled according to standards instead of genetics; (2) with the obtained certificates, RFCcert not only reveals the invalidity of traditional differential testing but also is able to conduct testing that traditional differential testing cannot do; and (3) the supporting tool of RFCcert has been implemented and extensive experiments show that the approach is effective in finding bugs of SSL/TLS implementations.

Redefining Prioritization: Continuous Prioritization for Continuous Integration,
Reducer-Based Construction of Conditional Verifiers," Despite recent advances, software verification remains challenging. To solve hard verification tasks, we need to leverage not just one but several different verifiers employing different technologies. To this end, we need to exchange information between verifiers. Conditional model checking was proposed as a solution to exactly this problem: The idea is to let the first verifier output a condition which describes the state space that it successfully verified and to instruct the second verifier to verify the yet unverified state space using this condition. However, most verifiers do not understand conditions as input. In this paper, we propose the usage of an off-the-shelf construction of a conditional verifier from a given traditional verifier and a reducer. The reducer takes as input the program to be verified and the condition, and outputs a residual program whose paths cover the unverified state space described by the condition. As a proof of concept, we designed and implemented one particular reducer and composed three conditional model checkers from the three best verifiers at SV-COMP 2017. We defined a set of claims and experimentally evaluated their validity. All experimental data and results are available for replication. "

Search-Based Test Data Generation for SQL Queries," Database-centric systems strongly rely on SQL queries to manage and manipulate their data. These SQL commands can range from very simple selections to queries that involve several tables, subqueries, and grouping operations. And, as with any important piece of code, developers should properly test SQL queries. In order to completely test a SQL query, developers need to create test data that exercise all possible coverage targets in a query, e.g., JOINs and WHERE predicates. And indeed, this task can be challenging and time-consuming for complex queries. Previous studies have modeled the problem of generating test data as a constraint satisfaction problem and, with the help of SAT solvers, generate the required data. However, such approaches have strong limitations, such as partial support for queries with JOINs, subqueries, and strings (which are commonly used in SQL queries). In this paper, we model test data generation for SQL queries as a search-based problem. Then, we devise and evaluate three different approaches based on random search, biased random search, and genetic algorithms (GAs). The GA, in particular, uses a fitness function based on information extracted from the physical query plan of a database engine as search guidance. We then evaluate each approach in 2,135 queries extracted from three open source software and one industrial software system. Our results show that GA is able to completely cover 98.6% of all queries in the dataset, requiring only a few seconds for each query. Moreover, it does not suffer from the limitations affecting state-of-the art techniques. "
Secure Coding Practices in Java: Challenges and Vulnerabilities,
Self-Hiding Behavior in Android Apps: Detection and Characterization,
Semantic Program Repair Using a Reference Implementation," Automated program repair has been studied via the use of techniques involving search, semantic analysis and artificial intelligence. Most of these techniques rely on tests as the correctness criteria, which causes the test overfitting problem. Although various approaches such as learning from code corpus have been proposed to address this problem, they are unable to guarantee that the generated patches generalize beyond the given tests. This work studies automated repair of errors using a reference implementation. The reference implementation is symbolically analyzed to automatically infer a specification of the intended behavior. This specification is then used to synthesize a patch that enforces conditional equivalence of the patched and the reference programs. The use of the reference implementation as an implicit correctness criterion alleviates overfitting in test-based repair. Besides, since we generate patches by semantic analysis, the reference program may have a substantially different implementation from the patched program, which distinguishes our approach from existing techniques for regression repair like Relifix. Our experiments in repairing the embedded Linux Busybox with GNU Coreutils as reference (and vice-versa) revealed that the proposed approach scales to real-world programs and enables the generation of more correct patches.

Sentiment Analysis for Software Engineering: How Far Can We Go?,
Software Protection on the Go: A Large-Scale Empirical Study on Mobile App Obfuscation," The prosperity of smartphone markets has raised new concerns about software security on mobile platforms, leading to a growing demand for effective software obfuscation techniques. Due to various differences between the mobile and desktop ecosystems, obfuscation faces both technical and non-technical challenges when applied to mobile software. Although there have been quite a few software security solution providers launching their mobile app obfuscation services, it is yet unclear how real-world mobile developers perform obfuscation as part of their software engineering practices. Our research takes a first step to systematically studying the deployment of software obfuscation techniques in mobile software development. With the help of an automated but coarse-grained method, we computed the likelihood of an app being obfuscated for over a million app samples crawled from Apple App Store. We then inspected the top 6600 instances and managed to identify 601 obfuscated versions of 539 iOS apps. By analyzing this sample set with extensive manual effort, we made various observations that reveal the status quo of mobile obfuscation in the real world, providing insights into understanding and improving the situation of software protection on mobile platforms.

Spatio-Temporal Context Reduction: A Pointer-Analysis-Based Static Approach for Detecting Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities,
Speedoo: Prioritizing Performance Optimization Opportunities,
Static Automated Program Repair for Heap Properties," Static analysis tools have demonstrated effectiveness at finding bugs in real world code. Such tools are increasingly widely adopted to improve software quality in practice. Automated Program Repair (APR) has the potential to further cut down on the cost of improving software quality. However, there is a disconnect between these effective bug-finding tools and APR. Recent advances in APR rely on test cases, making them inapplicable to newly discovered bugs or bugs difficult to test for deterministically (like memory leaks). Additionally, the quality of patches generated to satisfy a test suite is a key challenge. We address these challenges by adapting advances in practical static analysis and verification techniques to enable a new technique that finds and then accurately fixes real bugs without test cases. We present a new automated program repair technique using Separation Logic. At a high-level, our technique reasons over semantic effects of existing program fragments to fix faults related to general pointer safety properties: resource leaks, memory leaks, and null dereferences. The procedure automatically translates identified fragments into source-level patches, and verifies patch correctness with respect to reported faults. In this work we conduct the largest study of automatically fixing undiscovered bugs in realworld code to date. We demonstrate our approach by correctly fixing 55 bugs, including 11 previously undiscovered bugs, in 11 real-world projects. "
Statistical Errors in Software Engineering Experiments: A Preliminary Literature Review," Background: Statistical concepts and techniques are often applied incorrectly, even in mature disciplines such as medicine or psychology. Surprisingly, there are very few works that study statistical problems in software engineering (SE). Aim: Assess the existence of statistical errors in SE experiments. Method: Compile the most common statistical errors in experimental disciplines. Survey experiments published in ICSE to assess whether errors occur in high quality SE publications. Results: The same errors as identified in others disciplines were found in ICSE experiments, where 30% of the reviewed papers included several error types such as: a) missing statistical hypotheses, b) missing sample size calculation, c) failure to assess statistical test assumptions, and d) uncorrected multiple testing. This rather large error rate is greater for research papers where experiments are confined to the validation section. The origin of the errors can be traced back to: a) researchers not having sufficient statistical training, and, b) a profusion of exploratory research. Conclusions: This paper provides preliminary evidence that SE research suffers from the same statistical problems as other experimental disciplines. However, the SE community appears to be unaware of any shortcomings in its experiments, whereas other disciplines work hard to avoid these threats. Further research is necessary to find the underlying causes and set up corrective measures, but there are some potentially effective actions and are a priori easy to implement: a) improve the statistical training of SE researchers, and b) enforce quality assessment and reporting guidelines in SE publications.

Statistical Learning of API Fully Qualified Names in Code Snippets of Online Forums,
Symbolic Verification of Regular Properties," Verifying the regular properties of programs has been a significant challenge. This paper tackles this challenge by presenting symbolic regular verification (SRV) that offers significant speedups over the state-of-the-art. SRV is based on dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) and enabled by novel techniques for mitigating path explosion: (1) a regular property-oriented path slicing algorithm, and (2) a synergistic combination of property-oriented path slicing and guiding. Slicing prunes redundant paths, while guiding boosts the search for counterexamples. We have implemented SRV for Java and evaluated it on 15 real-world open-source Java programs (totaling 259K lines of code). Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SRV. Compared with the state-of-the-art — pure DSE, pure guiding, and pure path slicing — SRV achieves average speedups of more than 8.4X, 8.6X, and 7X, respectively, making symbolic regular property verification significantly more practical.

Synthesizing Qualitative Research in Software Engineering: A Critical Review,
Testing Vision-Based Control Systems Using Learnable Evolutionary Algorithms," Vision-based control systems are key enablers of many autonomous vehicular systems, including self-driving cars. Testing such systems is complicated by complex and multidimensional input spaces. We propose an automated testing algorithm that builds on learnable evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms rely on machine learning or a combination of machine learning and Darwinian genetic operators to guide the generation of new solutions (test scenarios in our context). Our approach combines multiobjective population-based search algorithms and decision tree classification models to achieve the following goals: First, classification models guide the search-based generation of tests faster towards critical test scenarios (i.e., test scenarios leading to failures). Second, search algorithms refine classification models so that the models can accurately characterize critical regions (i.e., the regions of a test input space that are likely to contain most critical test scenarios). Our evaluation performed on an industrial automotive automotive system shows that: (1) Our algorithm outperforms a baseline evolutionary search algorithm and generates 78% more distinct, critical test scenarios compared to the baseline algorithm. (2) Our algorithm accurately characterizes critical regions of the system under test, thus identifying the conditions that are likely to lead to system failures. "
The Evolution of Requirements Practices in Software Startups," We use Grounded Theory to study the evolution of requirements practices of 16 software startups as they grow and introduce new products and services. These startups operate in a dynamic environment, with significant time and market pressure, and rarely have time for systematic requirements analysis. Our theory describes the evolution of practice along six dimensions that emerged as relevant to their requirements activities: requirements artefacts, knowledge management, requirements-related roles, planning, technical debt and product quality. Beyond the relationships among the dimensions, our theory also explains the turning points that drove the evolution along these dimensions. These changes are reactive, rather than planned, suggesting an overall pragmatic lightness, i.e., flexibility, in the startups’ evolution towards engineering practices for requirements. Our theory organises knowledge about evolving requirements practice in maturing startups, and provides practical insights for startups’ assessing their own evolution as they face challenges to their growth. Our research also suggests that a startup’s evolution along the six dimensions is not fundamental to its success, but has significant effects on their product, their employees and the company. "
The Road to Live Programming: Insights From the Practice,
Time to Clean your Test Objectives," Testing is the primary approach for detecting software defects. A major challenge faced by testers lies in crafting efficient test suites, able to detect a maximum number of bugs with manageable effort. To do so, they rely on coverage criteria, which define some precise test objectives to be covered. However, many common criteria specify a significant number of objectives that occur to be infeasible or redundant in practice, like covering dead code or semantically equal mutants. Such objectives are well-known to be harmful to the design of test suites, impacting both the efficiency and precision of the tester’s effort. This work introduces a sound and scalable technique to prune out a significant part of the infeasible and redundant objectives produced by a panel of white-box criteria. In a nutshell, we reduce this task to proving the validity of logical assertions in the code under test. The technique is implemented in a tool that relies on weakest-precondition calculus and SMT solving for proving the assertions. The tool is built on top of the Frama-C verification platform, which we carefully tune for our specific scalability needs. The experiments reveal that the pruning capabilities of the tool can reduce the number of targeted test objectives in a program by up to 27% and scale to real programs of 200K lines, making it possible to automate a painstaking part of their current testing process.

To Distribute or Not to Distribute? Why Licensing Bugs Matter,
To Preserve or Not to Preserve Invalid Solutions in Search-Based Software Engineering: A Case Study in Software Product Lines,
Towards Optimal Concolic Testing," Concolic testing integrates concrete execution (e.g., random testing) and symbolic execution for test case generation. It is shown to be more cost-effective than random testing or symbolic execution sometimes. A concolic testing strategy is a function which decides when to apply random testing or symbolic execution, and if it is the latter case, which program path to symbolically execute. Many heuristics-based strategies have been proposed. It is still an open problem what is the optimal concolic testing strategy. In this work, we make two contributions towards solving this problem. First, we show the optimal strategy can be defined based on the probability of program paths and the cost of constraint solving. The problem of identifying the optimal strategy is then reduced to a model checking problem of Markov Decision Processes with Costs. Secondly, in view of the complexity in identifying the optimal strategy, we design a greedy algorithm for approximating the optimal strategy. We conduct two sets of experiments. One is based on randomly generated models and the other is based on a set of C programs. The results show that existing heuristics have much room to improve and our greedy algorithm often outperforms existing heuristics. "
Towards Practical Program Repair with On-Demand Candidate Generation,
Towards Refactoring-Aware Regression Test Selection,
Traceability in the Wild: Automatically Augmenting Incomplete Trace links," Software and systems traceability is widely accepted as an essential element for supporting many software development tasks. Today’s version control systems provide inbuilt features that allow developers to tag each commit with one or more issue ID, thereby providing the building blocks from which project-wide traceability can be established between feature requests, bug fixes, commits, source code, and specific developers. However, our analysis of six open source projects showed that on average only 60% of the commits were linked to specific issues. Without these fundamental links the entire set of project-wide links will be incomplete, and therefore not trustworthy. In this paper we address the fundamental problem of missing links between commits and issues. Our approach leverages a combination of process and text-related features characterizing issues and code changes to train a classifier to identify missing issue tags in commit messages, thereby generating the missing links. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our approach against six open source projects and showed that it was able to effectively recommend links for tagging issues at an average of 96% recall and 33% precision. In a related task for augmenting a set of existing trace links, the classifier returned precision at levels greater than 89% in all projects and recall of 50%. "

Understanding Developers’ Needs on Deprecation as a Language Feature," Deprecation is a language feature that allows API producers to mark a feature as obsolete. We aim to gain a deep understanding of the needs of API producers and consumers alike regarding deprecation. To that end, we investigate why API producers deprecate features, whether they remove deprecated features, how they expect consumers to react, and what prompts an API consumer to react to deprecation. To achieve this goal we conduct semi-structured interviews with 17 third-party Java API producers and survey 170 Java developers. We observe that the current deprecation mechanism in Java and the proposal to enhance it does not address all the needs of a developer. This leads us to propose and evaluate three further enhancements to the deprecation mechanism. "

When Testing Meets Code Review: Why and How Developers Review Tests," Automated testing is considered an essential process for ensuring software quality. However, writing and maintaining high-quality test code is challenging and frequently considered of secondary importance. For production code, many open source and industrial software projects employ code review, a well-established software quality practice, but the question remains whether and how code review is also used for ensuring the quality of test code. The aim of this research is to answer this question and to increase our understanding of what developers think and do when it comes to reviewing test code. We conducted both quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze more than 300,000 code reviews, and interviewed 12 developers about how they review test files. This work resulted in an overview of current code reviewing practices, a set of identified obstacles limiting the review of test code, and a set of issues that developers would like to see improved in code review tools. The study reveals that reviewing test files is very different from reviewing production files, and that the navigation within the review itself is one of the main issues developers currently face. Based on our findings, we propose a series of recommendations and suggestions for the design of tools and future research. "
