Feature Terms Prediction: A Feasible Way to Indicate the Notion of Features in Software Product Line,"In Software Product Lines (SPL), feature extraction from software requirements specifications has been subject to intense research in order to assist domain analysis in a time-saving way. Although various approaches are proposed to extract features, ..."
Exploring the Characteristics of Spectra Distribution and Their Impacts on Fault Localization,"Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) follows the basic intuitions that the faulty parts are more likely to be covered by failure-revealing test cases and less likely to be covered by passed test cases. However, due to the diversity of programs and ..."
Using the Lexicon from Source Code to Determine Application Domain,"Context: The vast majority of software engineering research is reported independently of the application domain: techniques and tools usage is reported without any domain context. As reported in previous research, this has not always been so: early in ..."
Assessing software defection prediction performance: why using the Matthews correlation coefficient matters,"Context: There is considerable diversity in the range and design of computational experiments to assess classifiers for software defect prediction. This is particularly so, regarding the choice of classifier performance metrics. Unfortunately some ..."
Publication Bias: A Detailed Analysis of Experiments Published in ESEM,Background: Publication bias is the failure to publish the results of a study based on the direction or strength of the study findings. The existence of publication bias is firmly established in areas like medical research. Recent research suggests the ...
Reasoning about Uncertainty in Empirical Results,"Conclusions that are drawn from experiments are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. For example, they might rely on small data sets, employ statistical techniques that make assumptions that are hard to verify, or there may be unknown confounding ..."
Studying Onboarding in Distributed Software Teams: A Case Study and Guidelines,"Many companies have turned towards globally distributed software development in their quest for access to more development capacity. This paper investigates how a company onboarded distributed teams in a global project, and report experience on how to ..."
Which Software Faults Are Tests Not Detecting?,Context: Software testing plays an important role in assuring the reliability of systems. Assessing the efficacy of testing remains challenging with few established test effectiveness metrics. Those metrics that have been used (e.g. coverage and ...
Is Exceptional Behavior Testing an Exception?: An Empirical Assessment Using Java Automated Tests,"Software testing is a crucial activity to check the internal quality of a software. During testing, developers often create tests for the normal behavior of a particular functionality (e.g., was this file properly uploaded to the cloud?). However, ..."
Caveats in Eliciting Mobile App Requirements,Factors such as app stores or platform choices heavily affect functional and non-functional mobile app requirements. We surveyed 45 companies and interviewed ten experts to explore how factors that impact mobile app requirements are understood by ...
Investigating the Correlation between Performance Scores and Energy Consumption of Mobile Web Apps,"Context. Developers have access to tools like Google Lighthouse to assess the performance of web apps and to guide the adoption of development best practices. However, when it comes to energy consumption of mobile web apps, these tools seem to be ..."
Mining Decision-Making Processes in Open Source Software Development: A Study of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) using Email Repositories,"Open source software (OSS) communities are often able to produce high quality software comparable to proprietary software. The success of an open source software development (OSSD) community is often attributed to the underlying governance model, and a ..."
Surveying Software Practitioners on Technical Debt Payment Practices and Reasons for not Paying off Debt Items,"Background: Little is known about the practices used for technical debt (TD) payment. The study of payment practices, as well as the reasons for not applying them, can help practitioners to control and manage TD items. Aims: To investigate, from the ..."
How Do FOSS Communities Decide to Accept Pull Requests?,"Pull requests are a method to facilitate review and management of contribution in distributed software development. Software developers author commits, and present them in a pull request to be inspected by maintainers and reviewers. The success and ..."
A Better Set of Object-Oriented Design Metrics for Within-Project Defect Prediction,"Background: Using design metrics to predict fault-prone elements of a software design can help to focus attention on classes that need redesign and more extensive testing. However, some design metrics have been pointed out to be theoretically invalid, ..."
Actionable Software Metrics: An Industrial Perspective,"Background: Practitioners would like to take action based on software metrics, as long as they find them reliable. Existing literature explores how metrics can be made reliable, but remains unclear if there are other conditions necessary for a metric to ..."
Documentation of Quality Requirements in Agile Software Development,"Context: Quality requirements (QRs) have a significant role in the success of software projects.
